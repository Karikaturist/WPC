ISSUE #18 - Text Editor
===
Problem: create simple text editor for VT100 terminal

Many of us remember Borland's TUrbo Pascal V3 which in 39K had compiler, linker, run-time library and minimal text editor.
BAS-INT is freeware tiny Basic interpreter with the bare minimum for BASIC scripting language. It works with external files only.
The Challenge today is to write minimal editor which to perform some very basic commands:

List - list the program in memory with numbers
Delete N(-M) - deletes line N or N to M from memory
Insert N - inserts line on number N
Run - runs the BASIC program in memory (this code is already available) on GitHub

if one wants to make it even more advanced he may make also the 
Edit N - prints the content of line N and allow it to be edited

remember we have just serial in and serial out streams no fancy colors, no graphics in this editor.
