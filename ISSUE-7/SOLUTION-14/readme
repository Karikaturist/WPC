Hello,

solution follows. Here's the rationale:

The cat can jump by either one or two stairs . The amount of stairs is fixed, 
denote it N ; N is natural number (excluding zero). Denote x the number of times 
the cat jumps one stair, denote y the number of times the cat jumps two stairs ; 
x,y natural numbers including zero (\math{N}^0). The following equation holds:

1 * x + 2 * y = N                                                    (1.1)

So, to get rid of the cat, this can be transformed to "find all numbers such 
that their digits consist of element of set {1,2} and their digit sum is N". And 
this can be rewritten as:

C(N) = \sum_{y=0}^{\floor{N/2}} \frac{((N-2*y)+y)!}{(N-2*y)!*y!}     (1.2)

Mapping this back to jumping cat, y is the number of two-stairs jumps, but we 
care only for the amount, which can be at most N/2 rounded down to nearest 
natural number. After doing y two-stair jumps, the cat can only do x=N-2*y 
single-stair jumps. Therefore each round of the sum produces one fitting 
solution for the equation (1.1) .

For each fitting solution of (1.1), we now calculate a simple permutation with 
repetition of x and y elements, P'(x, y)=\frac{(x+y)!}{x!y!} . Finally, 
summation of the permutations will produce the final result, C(N) (as for cat, 
parametrized by N). Find result at [1], just adjust the N as needed.

...

Here is another interesting thing about the above summation. By observation, one 
can notice the summation behaves similar to FIB(N) function:

FIB_{N+1} = \sum_{y=0}^{\floor{N/2}} (N-y \choose y)

Let's try to proove this:

C(N) = FIB_{N+1}

\sum_{y=0}^{\floor{N/2}} \frac{((N-2*y)+y)!}{(N-2*y)!*y!} = 
\sum_{y=0}^{\floor{N/2}} (N-y \choose y)

We can remove the summations:

\frac{((N-2*y)+y)!}{(N-2*y)!*y!} = (N-y \choose y)

Expanding the combination number on the right:

\frac{((N-2*y)+y)!}{(N-2*y)!*y!} = \frac{(N-y)!}{y!*(N-y-y)!}

Notice both the nominator and denominator are equal. And therefore finally:

C(N) = FIB_{N+1} .

NOTE: We need to define C(0) = 0 by hand.
