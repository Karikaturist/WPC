Hi,
I have attached a python script to implement a solution for WPC #7. It is
basically a fibonacci implementation with memoization. (total_ways =
cat_walk(n-1) + cat_walk(n-2))

$ python cat_walk.py 1 2 3 4 5
Total ways for 1 steps: 1
Total ways for 2 steps: 2
Total ways for 3 steps: 3
Total ways for 4 steps: 5
Total ways for 5 steps: 8

Thanks and Regards
Damu
