WPC-5 C++ Solution (Buffon's Needle)

Mersenne twister is used to generate random numbers needed for calculating
Pi. 

Code can calculate Pi for both cases, where the distance between lines (d)
greater the the length of the needle (l), and when the length of the needle
is smaller the the distance between parallel lines.

The tricky part is randomizing the direction (the theta angle) without usage
of the Pi constant. To see the details, end explanation for the algorithm 
used please see: http://www.efg2.com/Lab/Mathematics/Buffon.htm .
 
To compile C++ compiler which supports C++11 is needed. 
GCC version 4.7.2 was used to test the code.
Please use  "make" to build the executable.
