Hi,

Attached is my solution to this week's WPC. It's made in C and will only
run successfully as root on sunxi hardware as it uses the sunxi hardware
PRNG via /dev/mem (I have only tested it on sun4i, but it should
theorically work on sun5i too)

To compile, run something like "make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-"
then push the binary to your sunxi device of choice and run it as root:

$ sudo ./approximate-pi 5 6 213
Simulating 213 runs with needles of length 5.00 and stripes of length 6.00
PI is approximately 3.141593 (113/213 across)

As it uses a PRNG, the results should be completely reproducible
assuming you use the same simulation parameters and the same seed. You
can change the seed in the code (seedval array in main()) if you wish to.

I'm not too happy with the code quality, but the weekend is almost over
and I need to get other things done still :) I hope you like it.

Cheers,

Emilio
