/*
 * OLIMEX WEEKEND PROGRAMMING CHALLENGE ISSUE #5
 * author: Hanspeter Portner
 * language: C
 *
 * h: needle length
 * w: strip width
 * n: # of needles to throw
 * h: # of needles crossing a line
 * i: counter
 * x: distance of needle center to nearest line (random)
 * e: distance of needle ending from needle center measured perpendicular to the strips (random)
 *
 * (X,Y): random point in a normalized circle around needle center (that's where the needle points to)
 * L2: square of the distance L of the random point (X,Y) from the needle center
 * Pi: approximated Pi
 *
 * When e >= x, then we have a crossing, so we just need to get to e...
 * The simplest approach would be e=l*sin(theta), where theta is the random angle [0:Pi]
 * the needle is pointing to, but as we want to approximate Pi, we cannot use it in the calculation...
 * Apart from that, sine is slow...
 * Instead of a random angle giving us the direction of the needle, we use a random point (X,Y)
 * in a normalized circle around the needle center.
 * With two similar triangles, we have y/(0.5l) = Y/L = Y/sqrt(XX+YY), and we get e = 0.5l*Y/sqrt(X*X+YY)
