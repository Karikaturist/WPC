ISSUE#5 - Buffon's Needles
===

Problem:

Buffon’s needle problem is question first posted in 18th century by  Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon.

At this time people enjoyed betting on coins tossed on the floor, would they cross a wooden strips lines or not.

Buffon start thinking about this problem and worked out the probability which was named at his name, and as gambling with coins is bad thing they named it “Buffon Needle” replacing coins with needles.

More about the theory is explained here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon’s_needle

And this animated gif shows the principle used: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Buffon%27s_(short)_needle_problem.gif

This Flash animation visualize the Buffon’s Needle solution: http://www.metablake.com/pi.swf

The challenge for you this weekend is to make program in your favourite programming language which takes as inputs the needle length, the stripes width and the number of needles to be thrown, then calculates Pi using Buffon’s method using the computer random numbers generator.

Solutions:
==

1. Hanspeter Portner, C - works in both cases of short and long needles
