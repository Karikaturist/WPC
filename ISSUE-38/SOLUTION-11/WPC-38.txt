(*Import the file from the URL given in the blog post, use "Binarize" \
to convert it to a strictly black-and-white image*)
blkandwhiteimg = 
 Binarize[Import@
   "http://olimex.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/100x100.png"]

(*get the image data as an array of pixel values*)
pixels = 
 ImageData[
  blkandwhiteimg];(* now I have a 100x100 array; value = 1 for white, \
0 for black*)

(*Generate an array of coords where value=0 (black pixel).
This coordinate system runs from the top of the image to the bottom.
{1,1} is top left, {100,100} is bottom right
*)
blackpixelcoords = Position[pixels, 0];

(*Just about done now.  Take the mean of the coord-values, and that's \
it!*)
cofmcoords = Mean[blackpixelcoords];

Print["RESULT: coords of centre of mass are", cofmcoords // N] 

(*  Done!!  Note that in this coord-system, the centre of image is \
{50.5,50.5) *)
