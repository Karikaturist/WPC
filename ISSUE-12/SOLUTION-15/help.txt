Hi everyone,

My program with little bit bugs and I can not solve the problem at this momoment.

In most cases it returns correct results.

Such as:

input:
word

returns:
world
words
work
worm
wood
wore

input:
an

returns:
in
on
and
a
as
ran
at
am
any
can
fan
man
pan

But when you input words like "az", "buy", it doesn't work.
Anyone can figure it out?

Thanks,
Miller
