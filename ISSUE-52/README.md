ISSUE #52 - H-bot coordinates

H-bot is simple way to control X-Y CNC table with just two stepper motors and string. More on the subject you can find on the net.
Make code which moves the CNC table at position X,Y by rotating the two stepper motors. You know the string length, motor shaft diameter, etc parameters. Starting from center 0,0 you calculate the rotation angle of both motors when new X,Y coordinate is entered. 0,0 is in the center so XY can be positive and negative.
