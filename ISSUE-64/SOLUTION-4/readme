Hi Olimex!

Probably not the ideal solution to the problem but I designed my own Floyd
Steinberg-esque dithering where I convert a colour image into a black and
white image where the image brightness is dependent on the brightness of
the colour image, over a 3x3 pixel area. I've written a blog post on it
here: http://hsel.co.uk/2014/09/03/floyd-steinbergesque-dithering-in-matlab/

As you can probably tell by the title, I wrote it in Matlab. I started
writing it in C but never got round to it unfortunately.

My matlab code can be found in the attached text file.

Cheers!
Harris
