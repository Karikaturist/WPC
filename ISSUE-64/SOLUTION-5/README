Convert a colored image to grayscale.

Conversion of a color image to grayscale is not unique; different
weighting of the color channels effectively represent the effect of
shooting black-and-white film with different-colored photographic
filters on the cameras.

Colorimetric (luminance-preserving) conversion to grayscale

A common strategy is to use the principles of photometry or, more
broadly, colorimetry to match the luminance of the grayscale image to
the luminance of the original color image.[2][3] This also ensures that
both images will have the same absolute luminance, as can be measured in
its SI units of candelas per square meter, in any given area of the
image, given equal whitepoints. In addition, matching luminance provides
matching perceptual lightness measures, such as L* (as in the 1976 CIE
Lab color space) which is determined by the luminance Y (as in the CIE
1931 XYZ color space).

You might need to symlink for PIP to compile with PNG and JPEG support
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjpeg.so /usr/lib
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so /usr/lib

sudo pip install PIP
