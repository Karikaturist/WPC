It’s a C# forms application.

The m.bmp file contains a sample image for it to scan.

The main part of the program is in the Form1.cs file.  It scans the m.bmp file (m because it's the Olimex M from the logo) into on/off values for each led on the strip at each 1 degree angle.  The POV results.png shows the result of rendering the state of each led as it's spun through 360 degrees.

There's a fair bit of moire interference that no doubt could be ironed out with a more refined scan.

Is Olimex thinking of selling such a light strip to us?
