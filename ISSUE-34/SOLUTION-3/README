 OLIMEX WPC#34: POV LED display
    Persistence of Vision (POV) is made with stripe of LEDs which rotates at 360 degree.
    If we assume the stripe is with 100 LEDs you can make square “screen” with size approx 140×140 pixels.
    Make code which converts 140×140 pixels picture to array of LED stripe values for each angle 0-360. 
    When LED from the stripe are not at exact pixel positions the best way to set their value is to mediate the value 
    depend on the closest pixel neighbors.
    
    
    1)  ledstripe.py:  Outputs stripes for each angle as lists of the luminous leds
        usage: $ ./ledstripe.py  xbm_file
        
    2)  gled.py: Graphic demo/test for ledstripe.py
        usage: $ ./gled.py  xbm_file
