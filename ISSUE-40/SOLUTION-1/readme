this is in Haskell.

approach: basic breadth-first search on the various possibilities

it will find all solutions (until you ^C it or it runs out of memory),
with the shortest ones first - and uses Haskell's laziness to output
results as soon as they are found

use "first_sol 100" to find the first solution, or compile to a binary
with the GHC compiler

enjoy!
