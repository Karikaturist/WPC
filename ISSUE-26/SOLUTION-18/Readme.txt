Concept of this program:

1. Input 4 point A  B  C  D coordinates.
2. Find out 6 line segments AB BC CD AD AC BC.
3. Example:
    1)AB=BC=CD=AD
    2)AC=BD
    3)AB<AC
    4)2*AB*AB=AC*AC
4. The above four conditions make sure the 4 points define a square, otherwise it is not a square.


Perhaps I made this problem complex?   :)
