Hi,

My entry is a program for the venerable Intel 4004.  The entirety of the program is a whopping 2 bytes:

000: 04 00	JUN	$000

Of course the output is nothing more than chatter on the processor's address and data lines!  ;-)

To see it in all of its glorious action, do the following:

- go here

- enter "40 00" in the "ROM block:" area

- press the "LOAD" button

- in the "4004 CPU" area, press the "STEP" button and watch in amazement as the "CYCLES" count increases!  Astounding!


Thanks,
Dave
