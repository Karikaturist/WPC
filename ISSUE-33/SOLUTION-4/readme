Hi,

Here is my entry for WPC 33: infinite output:
+[.]

The language is brainfuck and the code above is 4 characters long
(no newline necessary).

The logic is following:
+    increase value at memory location 0 by 1 (from 0 to 1)
[    start loop if value at memory location 0 is not 0
.    print value from memory location 0
]    go back to [

The program will infinitely print ascii character SOH (0x01 in hex)
to the standard output.
