Hi,


I'd like to be called "Cae" and my solution is a shell script: >
	#!/bin/sh
	yes
<  3 chars command plus 9 chars (sometimes optional) shebang plus two newlines
(of  which  the  last  one  may be optional) equals a maximum number of needed
chars  of  14.   If  you  count  the  "real"  code that you just enter into an
interpreter, it's 4 chars for "yes\n".

It will output a infinite number of "y\n" lines.


Cheers,

	Cae
