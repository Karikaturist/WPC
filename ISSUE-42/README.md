ISSUE #42 - No Pen Lift Drawing
===
We all know this game where you draw figure on paper without lifting up your pen and without going through same segment twice.
For instance such drawings are fig.1 and fig.2 the red dot is where you start the drawing with the pen, the blue dot is where you end.
Some drawings can’t be drawn this way, for example fig.3
Problem:
Write code which enters N segments with their coordinates X1,Y1,X2,Y2 then check if it’s possible to draw all segments without lifting your pen and if YES write the path sequence.
