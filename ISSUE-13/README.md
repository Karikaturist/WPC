ISSUE#13 - ASCII Art converter
===

Problem: Make code which converts picture to ASCII art.

Hints: This is very easy challenge although seems hard at first sight. Just convert the picture from color to gray scale, then select font which you will use to print ASCII art and analyze it which letters you could use for gray scale print – every letter have some coefficient of filling from 0 for the space to 255 for solid bar, use letters which are spread well in the font size space. Then slice your image at rectangles with the font size, calculate the median grey scale for each rectangle and print the corresponding ASCII character with same grey scale value.
