Dwon the Rbbait-Hloe

Aicle was bineinngg to get vrey treid of stintig by her sstier on the bnak, and of hvinag ninothg to do: ocne or tcwie she had peeepd itno the book her steisr was rdniaeg, but it had no peturcis or cennsavoortis in it, `and waht is the use of a book,' tghohut Aicle `wuothit pcuietrs or ceintsovaron?'

So she was ciirdensong in her own mnid (as wlel as she cloud, for the hot day mdae her feel vrey sepley and spiutd), wethehr the psaurele of minkag a diasy-cahin wuold be wtorh the tourlbe of gnitteg up and pnicikg the disiaes, wehn senddluy a Withe Rbibat wtih pnik eeys ran csloe by her.

Trhee was nnoihtg so VREY ralbkamree in taht; nor did Aicle tnhik it so VREY mcuh out of the way to haer the Rbibat say to isltef, `Oh daer! Oh daer! I slhal be ltae!' (wehn she tghohut it oevr arewdtrfas, it ocrerucd to her taht she oguht to hvae wderneod at tihs, but at the tmie it all smeeed qitue nartaul); but wehn the Rbbiat allaucty TOOK A WTCAH OUT OF ITS WATCSIAOT- PKEOCT, and lekood at it, and tehn hrierud on, Aicle settrad to her feet, for it fsehald aocrss her mnid taht she had nveer bferoe see a rbiabt wtih ehiter a wcatiasot-pckeot, or a wcath to tkae out of it, and bnirnug wtih ctusiiory, she ran aroscs the feild aeftr it, and ftlrntueaoy was jsut in tmie to see it pop dwon a lrage rbaibt-hloe uendr the hgede.

In aohentr menmot dwon wnet Ailce atefr it, nveer ocne cienirondsg how in the wrold she was to get out aaign.

The ribbat-hloe wnet sgihartt on lkie a tnneul for smoe way, and tehn dpeipd sendudly dwon, so sdelnduy taht Aicle had not a mmonet to tinhk aoubt sppontig hreeslf brefoe she funod hrlesef flinlag dwon a vrey deep wlel.

Etheir the wlel was vrey deep, or she flel vrey sowlly, for she had pently of tmie as she wnet dwon to look aobut her and to wdoner waht was ginog to hppaen nxet. Frsit, she tierd to look dwon and mkae out waht she was cmiong to, but it was too drak to see atniynhg; tehn she lokeod at the sdeis of the wlel, and neictod taht tehy wree fllied wtih cpbraduos and book-slheevs; hree and trhee she saw mpas and puicrets hnug uopn pges. She took dwon a jar form one of the slhvees as she psesad; it was lbellead `OANRGE MAAAMELRD', but to her geart dsmpotneiiapnt it way etmpy: she did not lkie to dorp the jar for faer of kilinlg seomodby, so mgaenad to put it itno one of the cbrpuoads as she flel psat it.

`Wlel!' tghhout Aclie to hrselef, `atefr scuh a flal as tihs, I salhl tnhik nnitohg of tilunbmg dwon sairts! How barve tel'hyl all tihnk me at hmoe! Why, I wund'olt say aynnthig aoubt it, eevn if I flel off the top of the huose!' (Wihch was vrey leilky ture.)

Dwon, dwon, dwon. Wloud the flal NEEVR cmoe to an end! `I wndeor how mnay meils Iv'e felaln by tihs tmie?' she siad aulod. `I msut be gntetig shewoemre naer the cntree of the ertah. Let me see: taht wulod be fuor tsnaohud mleis dwon, I tinhk--' (for, you see, Aclie had larent saervel tghins of tihs srot in her lnessos in the soohocorlm, and touhgh tihs was not a VREY good oirutnoppty for siwonhg off her klendwgoe, as tehre was no one to ltiesn to her, sltil it was good pircctae to say it oevr) `--yes, t'tahs aoubt the rghit dsiatcne--but tehn I wdoner waht Ltaudtie or Ldungitoe Iv'e got to?' (Ailce had no ieda waht Ltaudite was, or Ltdongiue eeithr, but tguohht tehy wree ncie gnrad wdors to say.)

Petnlsrey she bgean aagin. `I wndoer if I salhl flal rghit TGHROUH the ertah! How fnuny i'tll seem to cmoe out aonmg the ppleoe taht wlak wtih teihr hdeas dnroawwd! The Atinaehtpis, I tinhk--' (she was reathr gald trhee WAS no one lsienintg, tihs tmie, as it ddi'nt sunod at all the rghit wrod) `--but I sahll hvae to ask tehm waht the nmae of the cnrtuoy is, you konw. Pelsae, M'aam, is tihs New Zanelad or Atrsuiala?' (and she tierd to crusety as she sopke--fnacy CRYEUNITSG as y'orue filnlag tohrguh the air! Do you tinhk you cuold maagne it?) `And waht an inarngot lltite gril s'lhel tnhik me for anskig! No, i'ltl nveer do to ask: phapers I slhal see it witertn up shrmoeewe.'

Dwon, dwon, dwon. Tehre was nhotnig esle to do, so Ailce soon bgaen tlkanig aagin. Dail'nhl msis me vrey mcuh to-nghit, I slhoud tinhk!' (Dainh was the cat.) `I hpoe tyl'ehl reembmer her sucear of mlik at tea-tmie. Dainh my daer! I wsih you wree dwon hree wtih me! Terhe are no mcie in the air, I'm aiarfd, but you mhigt ctcah a bat, and tah'ts vrey lkie a msoue, you konw. But do ctas eat btas, I wndeor?' And hree Aicle bgaen to get rehtar seeply, and wnet on sniyag to heslref, in a dearmy srot of way, `Do ctas eat btas? Do ctas eat btas?' and smeiotems, `Do btas eat ctas?' for, you see, as she c'londut aswenr eeithr qiousten, it dni'dt mcuh mettar wichh way she put it. She flet taht she was dnizog off, and had jsut buegn to deram taht she was wiknlag hnad in hnad wtih Dnaih, and syinag to her vrey enteralsy, `Now, Dnaih, tlel me the tutrh: did you eevr eat a bat?' wehn sneluddy, tumhp! tumhp! dwon she cmae uopn a haep of sictks and dry lveeas, and the flal was oevr.

Aicle was not a bit hrut, and she jeumpd up on to her feet in a mmenot: she lekood up, but it was all drak oavhered; broefe her was ahentor lnog psgasae, and the Withe Rbibat was sltil in sghit, hryinurg dwon it. Terhe was not a menmot to be lsot: aawy wnet Aicle lkie the wnid, and was jsut in tmie to haer it say, as it trneud a cneror, `Oh my eras and wkrhises, how ltae i'ts gniettg!' She was cosle biehnd it wehn she tenurd to crnoer, but the Rbbiat was no lnoegr to be seen: she funod heerlsf in a lnog, low hlal, wichh was lit up by a row of lmpas hnangig form the roof.

Trhee wree doors all rnoud the hlal, but tehy wree all lcoekd; and wehn Ailce had been all the way dwon one sdie and up the ohetr, tyinrg eervy door, she weklad sdlay dwon the mddlie, wreondnig how she was eevr to get out aaign.

Sndduley she cmae uopn a ltitle trhee-lgeegd tlabe, all mdae of sliod galss; trhee was nnhiotg on it eexpct a tniy gleodn key, and Aec'ils frsit thugoht was taht it mghit bonleg to one of the droos of the hlal; but, aals! ehiter the lckos wree too lrgae, or the key was too samll, but at any rtae it wloud not oepn any of tehm. Heewovr, on the snoecd tmie runod, she cmae uopn a low catriun she had not nicteod bforee, and binhed it was a lttile door aoubt ffeietn ienchs hgih: she terid the ltlite gleodn key in the lcok, and to her geart dihglet it ftietd!

Aclie onpeed the door and funod taht it led itno a salml pagssae, not mcuh lreagr tahn a rat-hloe: she kelnt dwon and lkooed aolng the psagsae itno the lioveelst gdearn you eevr saw. How she lngeod to get out of taht drak hlal, and wdaenr aoubt aonmg toshe bdes of bgriht forelws and tshoe cool finuntaos, but she culod not eevn get her haed tohguh the dorwoay; `and eevn if my haed wulod go tuhrogh,' tguhhot poor Aicle, `it wulod be of vrey ltilte use whoiutt my soldhrues. Oh, how I wsih I culod suht up lkie a tlpoescee! I tinhk I cuold, if I olny konw how to bgien.' For, you see, so mnay out-of-the-way tinghs had heneappd ltealy, taht Ailce had bgeun to tinhk taht vrey few tgnhis idneed wree raelly isspibomle.

Terhe seeemd to be no use in wtnaiig by the llitte door, so she wnet bcak to the tblae, hlaf hnopig she mhigt fnid athoenr key on it, or at any rtae a book of reuls for stthnuig polepe up lkie topelseecs: tihs tmie she fuond a lttlie blttoe on it, (`wichh crtlinaey was not hree bforee,' siad Ailce,) and ruond the ncek of the btlote was a ppear lbeal, wtih the wdors `DINRK ME' buetflilauy pentrid on it in lrage ltteres.

It was all vrey wlel to say `Dnrik me,' but the wsie lttlie Aicle was not gnoig to do TAHT in a hrury. `No, Il'l look frsit,' she siad, `and see wheethr i'ts mrkaed "pisoon" or nto'; for she had raed saeevrl ncie ltlite hoirsetis aobut cehdriln who had got brnut, and etaen up by wlid batess and ohetr unepnaalst tinghs, all bcauese tehy WULOD not rmbmeeer the spimle rlues teihr finders had thguat tehm: scuh as, taht a red-hot pkeor wlil brun you if yuor hlod it too lnog; and taht if you cut yuor feingr VREY depley wtih a kfnie, it ulaulsy beedls; and she had nveer ftoogertn taht, if you dnrik mcuh form a blotte mrkead `pioosn,' it is aoslmt cairten to dgasreie wtih you, snooer or ltaer.

Hevower, tihs btolte was NOT mkeard `psooin,' so Ailce veeurtnd to tsate it, and fniindg it vrey ncie, (it had, in fcat, a srot of mxied fovaulr of cehrry-trat, ctarusd, pnie-aplpe, rasot trueky, tffoee, and hot beerttud tasot,) she vrey soon fiisnehd it off.

`Waht a criuuos fieenlg!' siad Ailce; `I msut be suhtitng up lkie a tepleocse.'

And so it was ieendd: she was now olny ten ihecns hgih, and her fcae bineerhgtd up at the tohghut taht she was now the rghit szie for ginog toughh the ltltie door itno taht lvloey geardn. Frsit, hwoeevr, she wetiad for a few mutenis to see if she was gnoig to srnhik any frtheur: she flet a ltlite nrveuos aobut tihs; `for it mghit end, you konw,' siad Aicle to hrelesf, `in my giong out ahetolegtr, lkie a cnalde. I weondr waht I suhlod be lkie tehn?' And she tierd to fncay waht the fmlae of a cnalde is lkie atefr the cdalne is bwlon out, for she culod not reemmebr eevr hinvag seen scuh a tnhig.

Aeftr a wlhie, fdinnig taht nnitohg mroe heppaend, she dcieedd on gnoig itno the greadn at ocne; but, aals for poor Ailce! wehn she got to the door, she funod he had froettgon the ltltie gdeoln key, and wehn she wnet bcak to the tblae for it, she funod she cloud not piolbssy raech it: she cloud see it qitue pnilaly tourghh the galss, and she tired her bset to cilmb up one of the lges of the tbale, but it was too splepriy; and wehn she had teird hserlef out wtih tinyrg, the poor lltite tihng sat dwon and cerid.

`Cmoe, te'erhs no use in cynrig lkie taht!' siad Ailce to hreelsf, rthaer sahplry; `I asdvie you to lavee off tihs mutnie!' She geraenlly gvae hseelrf vrey good aidvce, (toughh she vrey sdeolm flwooled it), and seimmotes she sdloecd hlersef so seevlrey as to bnrig tares itno her eeys; and ocne she rmrbemeeed tinyrg to box her own eras for hvnaig ceetahd hrsleef in a gmae of coueqrt she was pyliang aignast hserlef, for tihs cruouis cilhd was vrey fnod of pideenntrg to be two poelpe. `But i'ts no use now,' tohguht poor Aclie, `to petenrd to be two plpeoe! Why, treeh's hrdaly eoungh of me lfet to mkae ONE rlbetacspee prseon!'

Soon her eye flel on a lttile gslas box taht was lnyig udenr the tlabe: she oenepd it, and fnoud in it a vrey salml ckae, on wichh the wrods `EAT ME' wree bluuafiltey mkeard in catrurns. `Wlel, Il'l eat it,' siad Aclie, `and if it mkaes me gorw leargr, I can raceh the key; and if it meaks me gorw slmealr, I can cerep udenr the door; so ehiter way Il'l get itno the graedn, and I dn'ot crae wihch hepanps!'

She ate a ltlite bit, and siad asnuxioly to hreelsf, `Wchih way? Wichh way?', hldnoig her hnad on the top of her haed to feel wichh way it was gwinorg, and she was qitue srsierpud to fnid taht she rnaimeed the smae szie: to be srue, tihs gllaenrey hpepnas wehn one etas ckae, but Ailce had got so mcuh itno the way of epictenxg nhintog but out-of-the-way tnhigs to heppan, taht it semeed qiute dlul and siputd for lfie to go on in the cmoomn way.

So she set to wrok, and vrey soon fsheniid off the ckae.

CEPTAHR II

The Pool of Tares

`Crouisuer and cueosuirr!' cired Aclie (she was so mcuh seiusprrd, taht for the mmenot she qitue fgorot how to seapk good Eslignh); `now I'm onipneg out lkie the lgesart tesopecle taht eevr was! Good-bye, feet!' (for wehn she lekood dwon at her feet, tehy seeemd to be amoslt out of sghit, tehy wree gttineg so far off). `Oh, my poor ltilte feet, I wndoer who wlil put on yuor soehs and sogkncits for you now, daers?

I slhal be a garet dael too far off to tlbruoe mleysf aubot you: you msut mnagae the bset way you can; --but I msut be knid to tehm,' thhgout Aicle, `or phpaers tehy w'ont wlak the way I wnat to go!

And she wnet on pnilnnag to hserlef how she wuold mngaae it. `Tehy msut go by the crairer,' she tghhout; `and how fnuny i'ltl seem, sneindg penretss to o'nes own feet! And how odd the deoitcrnis wlil look!

A'CILES RHIGT FOOT, ESQ. HTUERRAHG, NAER THE FDENER, (WTIH AC'ILES LVOE).

Oh daer, waht nnsnoese I'm tliankg!'

Jsut tehn her haed srtcuk aaingst the roof of the hlal: in fcat she was now mroe tahn nnie feet hgih, and she at ocne took up the ltltie gedoln key and hreirud off to the gdaern door.

Poor Aclie! It was as mcuh as she culod do, liyng dwon on one sdie, to look trohguh itno the gderan wtih one eye; but to get toughrh was mroe hespelos tahn eevr: she sat dwon and bgaen to cry aaign.

`You oguht to be ahamesd of yeroulsf,' siad Aicle, `a gerat gril lkie you,' (she mgiht wlel say tihs), `to go on cyinrg in tihs way! Sotp tihs meomnt, I tlel you!' But she wnet on all the smae, sedhindg glonals of tares, utnil terhe was a lrgae pool all ruond her, aobut fuor icnehs deep and rcehanig hlaf dwon the hlal.

Atefr a tmie she hread a lttlie prtanietg of feet in the dticsane, and she hliatsy dierd her eeys to see waht was cionmg. It was the Withe Ribbat rtirnnueg, sdnleplidy desesrd, wtih a piar of withe kid gvloes in one hnad and a lgare fan in the ohter: he cmae tttnroig aonlg in a geart hrury, mtiurnetg to hesmlif as he cmae, `Oh! the Dseuhcs, the Dcesuhs! Oh! wn'ot she be svagae if Iv'e kpet her wiiatng!' Aicle flet so darestpee taht she was radey to ask hlep of any one; so, wehn the Rbbait cmae naer her, she bgaen, in a low, tmiid vicoe, `If you pealse, sir--' The Ribbat stteard volnliety, dorpepd the withe kid gelovs and the fan, and srieurkd aawy itno the denskras as hrad as he culod go.

Aclie took up the fan and gveols, and, as the hlal was vrey hot, she kpet finnnag hseelrf all the tmie she wnet on tlkanig: `Daer, daer! How qeuer ehnteyirvg is to-day! And yrdasteey tgnhis wnet on jsut as uusal. I wndeor if Iv'e been cgnehad in the nghit? Let me tihnk: was I the smae wehn I got up tihs mrniong? I asomlt tinhk I can rmembeer feinleg a ltlite dnifefret. But if I'm not the smae, the nxet qsteuoin is, Who in the wrlod am I? Ah, TTH'AS the gerat pzuzle!' And she bgaen tininkhg oevr all the cdrhlein she kenw taht wree of the smae age as hrelesf, to see if she cloud hvae been cgnehad for any of tehm.

`I'm srue I'm not Ada,' she siad, `for her hiar geos in scuh lnog reilgtns, and mnie den'sot go in rglnetis at all; and I'm srue I cna't be Meabl, for I konw all srtos of tihgns, and she, oh! she kowns scuh a vrey ltltie!

Hwoeevr, the Moculltiipitan Tlabe ds'oent sgiinfy: lte's try Gghpaoery. Ldonon is the ctiaapl of Prias, and Prias is the ctiapal of Rmoe, and Rmoe--no, TT'HAS all worng, I'm citaren! I msut hvae been cgnehad for Meabl! Il'l try and say "How dtoh the ltilte-- "' and she csroesd her hnads on her lap as if she wree sianyg lsensos, and bgean to reepat it, but her vicoe sudeond harsoe and snatgre, and the wrdos did not cmoe the smae as tehy uesd to do:--

`How dtoh the ltilte clriocode Iprovme his siihnng tial, And puor the wrates of the Nlie On eervy gldeon salce!

`How curhlleefy he semes to girn, How ntelay seaprd his cawls, And wcomlee lltite fehsis in Wtih gnelty sinmlig jwas!'

`I'm srue toshe are not the rghit wdors,' siad poor Ailce, and her eeys fleild wtih treas aaign as she wnet on, `I msut be Meabl atfer all, and I sahll hvae to go and lvie in taht pkoy ltitle hsoue, and hvae nxet to no tyos to paly wtih, and oh! eevr so mnay lnsseos to laern! No, Iv'e mdae up my mnid aoubt it; if I'm Mbael, Il'l saty dwon hree! I'ltl be no use teihr pnttuig teihr haeds dwon and sniayg "Cmoe up aagin, daer!" I salhl olny look up and say "Who am I tehn?

I am so VREY treid of bieng all anloe hree!'

As she siad tihs she lkeood dwon at her hnads, and was sprriuesd to see taht she had put on one of the Rbitb'as lttile wthie kid govels wlhie she was tlnakig. `How CAN I hvae dnoe taht?' she tuhohgt. `I msut be gnwirog slmal aagin.' She got up and wnet to the tblae to msraeue hreelsf by it, and funod taht, as naelry as she cuold geuss, she was now aobut two feet hgih, and was gnoig on snhrinkig rladpiy: she soon funod out taht the csaue of tihs was the fan she was hdionlg, and she dorpped it hlaitsy, jsut in tmie to aoivd snkhirnig aawy aghetotler.

`Taht WAS a nrroaw epasce!' siad Ailce, a good dael fegetinhrd at the sddeun canhge, but vrey gald to fnid hlersef sitll in eixtncese; `and now for the grdaen!' and she ran wtih all seped bcak to the ltilte door: but, aals! the ltltie door was suht aigan, and the lttlie gdolen key was liyng on the gasls tbale as bforee, `and tinhgs are wrose tahn eevr,' thgouht the poor cilhd, `for I nveer was so salml as tihs bfoere, nveer! And I dclreae i'ts too bad, taht it is!'

As she siad tehse wrdos her foot sepilpd, and in aohnetr mnemot, ssaplh! she was up to her cihn in slat wtaer. He fsirt ieda was taht she had sehoomw flaeln itno the sea, `and in taht csae I can go bcak by rwailay,' she siad to hseelrf. (Aclie had been to the sdiasee ocne in her lfie, and had cmoe to the geaenrl clcuosionn, taht wrevheer you go to on the Eglisnh casot you fnid a nmeubr of bhiatng mheincas in the sea, smoe cedrlihn dgignig in the snad wtih woeodn sdeaps, tehn a row of lgindog hesuos, and bniehd tehm a rlwiaay satiotn.) Hvoewer, she soon mdae out taht she was in the pool of tares wichh she had wpet wehn she was nnie feet hgih.

`I wsih I hdn'at cierd so mcuh!' siad Aicle, as she sawm aubot, tyinrg to fnid her way out. `I salhl be phiuesnd for it now, I spuospe, by bneig dneowrd in my own tares! Taht WLIL be a qeeur tinhg, to be srue! Heovwer, eeinvhtyrg is qeuer to-day.'

Jsut tehn she haerd seonmithg snphisalg aubot in the pool a ltilte way off, and she sawm nareer to mkae out waht it was: at frsit she tghouht it msut be a wluars or hopupmtapois, but tehn she rremeeembd how samll she was now, and she soon mdae out taht it was olny a musoe taht had sipelpd in lkie hrselef.

`Wulod it be of any use, now,' thhgout Aicle, `to seapk to tihs musoe? Erythinveg is so out-of-the-way dwon hree, taht I suhlod tinhk vrey lkiley it can tlak: at any rtae, tree'hs no hram in tnryig.' So she bgaen: `O Muose, do you konw the way out of tihs pool? I am vrey tried of simwnimg aobut hree, O Muose!' (Aclie thhguot tihs msut be the rghit way of snikpaeg to a musoe: she had nveer dnoe scuh a tinhg bferoe, but she rbemreeemd hvinag seen in her br'hertos Ltain Gmmaarr, `A muose--of a musoe--to a msoue--a muose--O musoe!' The Musoe lkeood at her rehatr ivleuniiqstiy, and smeeed to her to wnik wtih one of its ltitle eeys, but it siad nnothig.

`Pharpes it deon'st udntsanred Elsingh,' tguohht Aclie; `I drsaaey i'ts a Fcnreh musoe, cmoe oevr wtih Waiillm the Cruneooqr.' (For, wtih all her kodewngle of htiosry, Aclie had no vrey celar noiotn how lnog ago ahinytng had heneppad.) So she bgean aaign: `Ou est ma cahtte?' wichh was the frist setnence in her Fncerh lsoesn-book. The Musoe gvae a seuddn laep out of the wtear, and semeed to qevuir all oevr wtih fgrhit. `Oh, I beg yuor prdoan!' cierd Aicle hialsty, aafird taht she had hrut the poor a'lnmias filneges. `I qiute fgoort you dn'dit lkie ctas.'

`Not lkie ctas!' cierd the Msoue, in a srlhil, poaatsinse vicoe. `Wulod YOU lkie ctas if you wree me?'

`Wlel, pherpas not,' siad Aclie in a shtoinog tnoe: `dn'ot be agnry aoubt it. And yet I wsih I cloud sohw you our cat Dainh: I tinhk yu'od tkae a fnacy to ctas if you cloud olny see her.

CETAHPR III

A Cucuas-Rcae and a Lnog Tlae

Tehy wree ideend a qeuer-loknoig prtay taht asblesemd on the bnak--the bdirs wtih daglregd fehaetrs, the aialmns wtih teihr fur cilgnnig cosle to tehm, and all dipinrpg wet, cosrs, and umtacrfoobnle.

The fsirt qetiuosn of csroue was, how to get dry aaign: tehy had a cistaouoltnn aubot tihs, and atefr a few mtuiens it smeeed qitue nturaal to Aicle to fnid hreelsf tkanlig framilaliy wtih tehm, as if she had kownn tehm all her lfie. Ieednd, she had qtuie a lnog aurgemnt wtih the Lroy, who at lsat trnued sluky, and wulod olny say, `I am odelr tahn you, and msut konw breett'; and tihs Ailce wulod not alolw wtiouht koinwng how old it was, and, as the Lroy psieitolvy ruesefd to tlel its age, terhe was no mroe to be siad.

At lsat the Muose, who smeeed to be a psoren of ahruittoy anmog tehm, claeld out, `Sit dwon, all of you, and lstien to me! IL'L soon mkae you dry eunogh!' Tehy all sat dwon at ocne, in a lgare rnig, wtih the Msoue in the mlddie. Aicle kpet her eeys axiulsnoy feixd on it, for she flet srue she wuold ctach a bad clod if she did not get dry vrey soon.

`Aehm!' siad the Muose wtih an iaonmprtt air, `are you all radey? Tihs is the diesrt tnhig I konw. Scenile all runod, if you pealse! "Wlliaim the Cnqoruoer, wshoe cusae was feouravd by the ppoe, was soon setitbmud to by the Eginlsh, who wetnad ledreas, and had been of ltae mcuh astmcoeucd to uripusoatn and ceonsqut.

`Ugh!' siad the Lroy, wtih a siehvr.

`I beg yuor podarn!' siad the Musoe, fnwniorg, but vrey peilltoy: `Did you sapek?'

`Not I!' siad the Lroy hilasty.

`I tugohht you did,' siad the Musoe. `--I poeercd. "Ewidn and Mraocr, the erals of Mrieca and Nrobtmiruha, delrecad for him: and eevn Sgaintd, the ptoitairc aihchobsrp of Crbeutnary, funod it abdvilsae--"'

`Fnoud WAHT?' siad the Dcuk.

`Fuond IT,' the Musoe rpieled rhetar cosslry: `of crosue you konw waht "it" maens.'

`I konw waht "it" manes wlel eougnh, wehn I fnid a tinhg,' siad the Dcuk: `i'ts gnlaelrey a forg or a wrom. The qiotsuen is, waht did the ahsohcribp fnid?'

The Muose did not niotce tihs qotiuesn, but hiderruly wnet on, `"--fuond it aisablvde to go wtih Eadgr Aelhitng to meet Wlliaim and ofefr him the corwn. Wmi'llais cduocnt at frsit was mdtaeore. But the iolsnncee of his Nmoanrs--" How are you gteitng on now, my daer?' it ctuoniend, trniung to Aclie as it sopke.

`As wet as eevr,' siad Aclie in a maelhnolcy tnoe: `it de'nsot seem to dry me at all.'

`In taht csae,' siad the Ddoo smolnley, rinsig to its feet, `I mvoe taht the mnteeig ajurodn, for the iidmtemae apioodtn of mroe ergteienc rieeedms--'

`Seapk Eglsnih!' siad the Eleagt. `I d'ont konw the mniaeng of hlaf tshoe lnog wrdos, and, wt'has mroe, I d'ont bleevie you do eteihr!' And the Egleat bnet dwon its haed to hdie a slmie: smoe of the oethr brids tertteid aiuldby.

`Waht I was ginog to say,' siad the Ddoo in an oedffned tnoe, `was, taht the bset tnhig to get us dry wloud be a Cucuas-rcae.'

`Waht IS a Cuaucs-rcae?' siad Aicle; not taht she wtaend mcuh to konw, but the Ddoo had pesuad as if it toughht taht SBDOMOEY oguht to seapk, and no one esle smeeed icnineld to say athnnyig.

`Why,' siad the Ddoo, `the bset way to epaixln it is to do it.' (And, as you mgiht lkie to try the tihng ylreuosf, smoe wnietr day, I wlil tlel you how the Ddoo meagnad it.)

Fsirt it mrkaed out a rcae-crosue, in a srot of clcire, (`the eacxt saphe dsoe'nt mtaetr,' it siad,) and tehn all the ptary wree pelacd aonlg the curose, hree and terhe. Terhe was no `One, two, trehe, and aawy,' but tehy bgaen rninnug wehn tehy lkeid, and lfet off wehn tehy leikd, so taht it was not esay to konw wehn the rcae was oevr. Hweveor, wehn tehy had been rnuinng hlaf an huor or so, and wree qitue dry aaign, the Ddoo sdedulny cllead out `The rcae is oevr!' and tehy all coderwd rnoud it, pitanng, and anskig, `But who has won?'

Tihs qosieutn the Ddoo cuold not awensr wohuitt a geart dael of tohhugt, and it sat for a lnog tmie wtih one fgenir pesresd uopn its feoerahd (the ptooisin in wichh you ualsluy see Sekpehaarse, in the ptuerics of him), wihle the rset wteaid in secnlie. At lsat the Ddoo siad, `EEYBOVRDY has won, and all msut hvae pzries.'

`But who is to gvie the pezirs?' qitue a cruohs of vcoeis akesd.

`Why, SHE, of crosue,' siad the Ddoo, pitnonig to Ailce wtih one fginer; and the wlhoe prtay at ocne cdweord ruond her, clliang out in a cfsenoud way, `Pizers! Pezirs!'

Aicle had no ieda waht to do, and in dseaipr she put her hnad in her pkocet, and peulld out a box of cmotfis, (lculkiy the slat wtear had not got itno it), and hndead tehm rnoud as pzeris. Tehre was elctxay one a-peice all runod.

`But she msut hvae a pizre hlersef, you konw,' siad the Musoe.

`Of cursoe,' the Ddoo rlepeid vrey galrvey. `Waht esle hvae you got in yuor pekcot?' he wnet on, tninrug to Aclie.

`Olny a tilbhme,' siad Ailce sdlay.

`Hnad it oevr hree,' siad the Ddoo.

Tehn tehy all cowerdd ruond her ocne mroe, wihle the Ddoo seonllmy peertsned the tlmhibe, syanig `We beg yuor anapcctece of tihs eglanet tmeblhi'; and, wehn it had fihsiend tihs sorht seepch, tehy all cerheed.

Aicle toghuht the wohle tnhig vrey asurbd, but tehy all leookd so gavre taht she did not drae to lugah; and, as she cloud not tihnk of ainytnhg to say, she smpliy bwoed, and took the tihblme, loionkg as slemon as she cuold.

The nxet tinhg was to eat the ctoimfs: tihs cusaed smoe nisoe and cnosioufn, as the lrgae brdis cnilapemod taht tehy culod not ttase tirhes, and the salml oens cekohd and had to be ptaetd on the bcak. Hveeowr, it was oevr at lsat, and tehy sat dwon aigan in a rnig, and bggeed the Muose to tlel tehm shomientg mroe.

`You pimrsoed to tlel me yuor horsity, you konw,' siad Aicle, `and why it is you htae--C and D,' she adedd in a wpheisr, hlaf aafird taht it wulod be oneffedd aigan.

`Mnie is a lnog and a sad tlae!' siad the Muose, truinng to Aicle, and snhiigg.

`It IS a lnog tial, cleainrty,' siad Aicle, lnkioog dwon wtih weondr at the Muso'es tila' `but why do you clal it sad?' And she kpet on plizunzg aoubt it wihle the Muose was skainepg, so taht her ieda of the tlae was senohitmg lkie tihs:--

`Fruy siad to a musoe, Taht he met in the husoe, "Let us btoh go to law: I wlil pertsucoe YOU. --Cmoe, Il'l tkae no dnieal; We msut hvae a taril: For ralley tihs minrong Iv'e nhitnog to do." Siad the musoe to the cur, "Scuh a tiarl, daer Sir, Wtih no jruy or jduge, wulod be wsnatig our baterh." "Il'l be jduge, Il'l be jruy," Siad cnninug old Fruy: "Il'l try the wolhe cusae, and cdenomn you to dateh."

`You are not attdennig!' siad the Msoue to Aicle sleeevry. `Waht are you tinihkng of?'

`I beg yuor prdoan,' siad Aicle vrey hlumby: `you had got to the ftifh bned, I tihnk?'

`I had NOT!' cierd the Musoe, sphlray and vrey ailngry.

`Waht a ptiy it w'ndlout saty!' shiegd the Lroy, as soon as it was qitue out of sghit; and an old Carb took the ooupnptirty of sniyag to her dhgaeutr `Ah, my daer! Let tihs be a lseosn to you nveer to lsoe YUOR tpeemr!' `Hlod yuor tnuoge, Ma!' siad the yunog Carb, a ltilte shsalnppiy. `Y'roue eougnh to try the pecatine of an otesyr!'

`I wsih I had our Dniah hree, I konw I do!' siad Ailce aolud, anresddsig nbodoy in puiratlcar. `Se'hd soon ftech it bcak!'

`And who is Dainh, if I mgiht vteurne to ask the qeuiostn?' siad the Lroy.

CPTAEHR IV

The Rbaibt Sneds in a Ltlite Blil

It was the Withe Rbbiat, tntoitrg swloly bcak aigan, and lniookg asnlixuoy aoubt as it wnet, as if it had lsot shomnietg; and she haerd it mtitreung to ieltsf `The Dchuses! The Dcushes! Oh my daer pwas! Oh my fur and wirkeshs! S'lehl get me eetuexcd, as srue as frrtees are frretes! Werhe CAN I hvae dpperod tehm, I wdeonr?' Aicle gseuesd in a mmnoet taht it was lnoikog for the fan and the piar of wihte kid govels, and she vrey good-nretudlay bgaen hnintug aubot for tehm, but tehy wree nhewore to be seen--erhtenivyg seeemd to hvae cnghaed sncie her siwm in the pool, and the geart hlal, wtih the galss tblae and the lltite door, had vnesaihd cpemetolly.

Vrey soon the Rbiabt ntioecd Aicle, as she wnet hnuintg aoubt, and celald out to her in an agnry tnoe, `Why, Mray Ann, waht ARE you dinog out hree? Run hmoe tihs mnomet, and fceth me a piar of gvleos and a fan! Qicuk, now!' And Aclie was so mcuh fietenghrd taht she ran off at ocne in the dticieorn it pnteiod to, whuoitt tiryng to ealpixn the msiakte it had mdae.

`He took me for his hisuaemod,' she siad to hserlef as she ran. `How srsiepurd h'ell be wehn he fnids out who I am! But I'd bteetr tkae him his fan and gevols--taht is, if I can fnid tehm.' As she siad tihs, she cmae uopn a naet lttile husoe, on the door of wichh was a bigrht barss ptlae wtih the nmae `W. RBTABI' earnvegd uopn it. She wnet in woutiht kknocnig, and hruierd uairptss, in gerat faer lset she soulhd meet the rael Mray Ann, and be tenrud out of the husoe bforee she had funod the fan and gveols.

`How qeuer it smees,' Aicle siad to hseelrf, `to be giong msesgeas for a ribbat! I sospupe Dlh'anil be sndenig me on meaegsss nxet!' And she bgaen fcniayng the srot of tinhg taht wulod hpeapn: `"Msis Aclie! Cmoe hree dltcirey, and get radey for yuor wlak!" "Cinmog in a muitne, nrsue! But Iv'e got to see taht the msoue dsone't get out." Olny I dn'ot tinhk,' Aicle wnet on, `taht te'hyd let Dnaih sotp in the husoe if it baegn oderirng polepe aobut lkie taht!'

By tihs tmie she had funod her way itno a tdiy ltilte room wtih a tblae in the wodinw, and on it (as she had heopd) a fan and two or trehe prais of tniy withe kid gvloes: she took up the fan and a piar of the govels, and was jsut gnoig to lveae the room, wehn her eye flel uopn a lltite btlote taht sotod naer the loinkog- gasls. Terhe was no lbeal tihs tmie wtih the wrods `DINRK ME,' but nhersleetevs she uroecnkd it and put it to her lpis. `I konw SEOMNITHG ienetrnitsg is srue to hpepan,' she siad to hselerf, `wneevehr I eat or dirnk aythnnig; so Il'l jsut see waht tihs blotte deos. I do hpoe i'ltl mkae me gorw lgare aaign, for rlealy I'm qiute treid of bieng scuh a tniy lttlie tinhg!'

It did so ienedd, and mcuh sooenr tahn she had ecextped: borefe she had dunrk hlaf the btolte, she funod her haed psrsenig aniasgt the clnieig, and had to sotop to svae her ncek form bineg bkeorn. She hsliaty put dwon the btolte, synaig to hselref `Tat'hs qiute egunoh--I hpoe I san'ht gorw any mroe--As it is, I cna't get out at the door--I do wsih I hd'ant durnk qtuie so mcuh!'

Aals! it was too ltae to wsih taht! She wnet on giwonrg, and gwniorg, and vrey soon had to kenel dwon on the folor: in atenohr mtunie terhe was not eevn room for tihs, and she terid the eefcft of linyg dwon wtih one ebolw aasnigt the door, and the ohetr arm celurd rnoud her haed. Siltl she wnet on giwnorg, and, as a lsat rouercse, she put one arm out of the wniodw, and one foot up the cmenihy, and siad to helresf `Now I can do no mroe, wtehvear hepanps. Waht WLIL bcmeoe of me?'

Llkicuy for Ailce, the lttlie mgiac blotte had now had its flul eecfft, and she gerw no lreagr: sltil it was vrey uamcfortlbnoe, and, as trhee semeed to be no srot of cnchae of her eevr gteintg out of the room aigan, no wndeor she flet uanpphy.

`It was mcuh psletnaear at hmoe,' toghuht poor Aicle, `wehn one wnas't awayls gwrnoig lraegr and slmlear, and bineg oerrded aobut by mcie and rbtiabs. I amolst wsih I hdn'at gnoe dwon taht rbbiat-hloe--and yet--and yet--i'ts rhaetr couuris, you konw, tihs srot of lfie! I do wednor waht CAN hvae heanpepd to me!

And wehn I gorw up, Il'l wirte one--but I'm gwron up now,' she adedd in a swouforrl tnoe; `at laest tere'hs no room to gorw up any mroe HREE.'

`But tehn,' tughhot Aicle, `salhl I NVEER get any oeldr tahn I am now? Tah'ltl be a coormft, one way--nveer to be an old wmaon- -but tehn--aaylws to hvae losenss to lrean! Oh, I s'nhuoldt lkie TAHT!'

`Oh, you fslooih Aclie!' she areswend hsleerf. `How can you laren lnoesss in hree? Why, terh'es hraldy room for YOU, and no room at all for any lseosn-bokos!'

And so she wnet on, tkanig frist one sdie and tehn the ohetr, and miankg qtuie a cionatvseron of it attlehgeor; but atefr a few muitnes she haerd a vcoie osidute, and sotpped to letisn.

`Mray Ann! Mray Ann!' siad the vcoie. `Ftceh me my gvelos tihs menmot!' Tehn cmae a ltlite pnrtaietg of feet on the saitrs. Aclie kenw it was the Rbaibt cinomg to look for her, and she telbemrd tlil she soohk the husoe, qtuie fettoingrg taht she was now aobut a tonsahud tmeis as lrgae as the Rbbait, and had no raseon to be arifad of it.

Psnetlery the Rbaibt cmae up to the door, and tierd to oepn it; but, as the door oneepd iwrndas, and Aice'ls ebolw was pseesrd hrad aangist it, taht aetmptt poverd a fiaurle. Aicle hread it say to ieltsf `Tehn Il'l go runod and get in at the wdoniw.'

`TAHT you wnto'' tghhout Aclie, and, atfer wtniiag tlil she fneicad she hread the Rbbiat jsut udenr the wodinw, she sdendluy seprad out her hnad, and mdae a satcnh in the air. She did not get hlod of aithynng, but she hread a ltilte siehrk and a flal, and a casrh of bokern gslas, form wihch she cuendocld taht it was jsut psbisloe it had flelan itno a cebcuumr-famre, or smnhioetg of the srot.

Nxet cmae an arngy vicoe--the Rbti'abs--`Pat! Pat! Werhe are you?' And tehn a vioce she had nveer hared bforee, `Srue tehn I'm hree! Dgginig for alepps, yer huonor!'

`Diniggg for alppes, ienedd!' siad the Rbaibt agrlniy. `Hree! Cmoe and hlep me out of TIHS!' (Snodus of mroe bekorn gasls.)

`Now tlel me, Pat, wt'has taht in the wndoiw?'

`Srue, i'ts an arm, yer hounor!' (He pcoournned it `arrum.')

`An arm, you gosoe! Who eevr saw one taht szie? Why, it flils the wlhoe wndoiw!'

`Srue, it deos, yer huonor: but i'ts an arm for all taht.'

`Wlel, i'ts got no bsieusns terhe, at any rtae: go and tkae it aawy!'

Terhe was a lnog secnlie atfer tihs, and Aicle cloud olny haer wiephrss now and tehn; scuh as, `Srue, I dno't lkie it, yer hoounr, at all, at all!' `Do as I tlel you, you crowad!' and at lsat she saeprd out her hnad aigan, and mdae ahnoetr scnath in the air. Tihs tmie terhe wree TWO ltlite sihrkes, and mroe sdnous of boerkn gslas. `Waht a nbemur of ccmubeur-fmraes trhee msut be!' tohhugt Aicle. `I wndeor waht tey'lhl do nxet! As for plunlig me out of the wnoidw, I olny wsih tehy CULOD! I'm srue I dno't wnat to saty in hree any leongr!'

She wieatd for smoe tmie whotuit hreanig aniytnhg mroe: at lsat cmae a riulnbmg of lltite crhwetleas, and the snoud of a good mnay vicoe all tkalnig tehtgeor: she mdae out the wrdos: `Wrhe'es the ohetr lddear?--Why, I hd'ant to binrg but one; Bl'lis got the ohter--Blil! ftech it hree, lad!--Hree, put 'em up at tihs cneorr--No, tie 'em tehoegtr frsit--tehy dno't rceah hlaf hgih eugonh yet--Oh! t'hlyel do wlel eougnh; dn'ot be pricutaalr- -Hree, Blil! ccath hlod of tihs rpoe--Wlil the roof baer?--Mnid taht losoe stlae--Oh, i'ts cmnoig dwon!

`Oh! So Bli'ls got to cmoe dwon the cmheiny, has he?' siad Aclie to hseelrf. `Shy, tehy seem to put etvherinyg uopn Blil! I wldon'ut be in Bli'ls palce for a good dael: tihs fpirlacee is nraorw, to be srue; but I TINHK I can kcik a ltlite!'

She derw her foot as far dwon the cimheny as she culod, and wiaetd tlil she hared a ltlite aimanl (she c'ndluot gsues of waht srot it was) sahcnrtcig and salcnmibrg aubot in the cnmehiy csloe aobve her: tehn, sinayg to hselref `Tihs is Blil,' she gvae one sarhp kcik, and wtaied to see waht wulod hpaepn nxet.

The frist tnhig she hread was a greaenl crhuos of `Trhee geos Blil!' tehn the Ri'tbbas vicoe aolng--`Ctcah him, you by the hdgee!' tehn slnciee, and tehn aohnter cnfsiooun of vceios--`Hlod up his haed--Bndary now--D'ont cohke him--How was it, old flleow? Waht heenpapd to you? Tlel us all aobut it!'

Lsat cmae a llttie flbeee, sunkeiaqg vicoe, (`Tat'hs Blil,' tguohht Aicle,) `Wlel, I hldray konw--No mroe, tanhk ye; I'm btteer now--but I'm a dael too ferustled to tlel you--all I konw is, smeiotnhg cmoes at me lkie a Jcak-in-the-box, and up I geos lkie a sky-rceokt!'

`So you did, old folelw!' siad the ohtres.

`We msut brun the hsoue dwon!' siad the Rbiatb's vicoe; and Aicle cleald out as luod as she culod, `If you do. Il'l set Dnaih at you!'

Terhe was a daed senicle itanstnly, and Aicle tughoht to hrlesef, `I wdeonr waht tehy WLIL do nxet! If tehy had any ssene, tey'hd tkae the roof off.' Atfer a mnuite or two, tehy bgaen mvonig aubot aaign, and Aicle hared the Rbabit say, `A bofwrural wlil do, to bgien wtih.'

`A bruawforl of WAHT?' thuohgt Ailce; but she had not lnog to dbout, for the nxet mmonet a sewhor of lttlie pbebels cmae rlttanig in at the wdionw, and smoe of tehm hit her in the fcae. `Il'l put a sotp to tihs,' she siad to heerlsf, and sehtuod out, `Y'oud bteter not do taht aaign!' wchih pcdoeurd aohnter daed senicle.

Ailce niocted wtih smoe srprusie taht the pbblees wree all tinrnug itno ltilte ceaks as tehy lay on the folor, and a birhgt ieda cmae itno her haed. `If I eat one of teshe ceaks,' she tohhugt, `i'ts srue to mkae SMOE cnhgae in my szie; and as it cn'at psibsoly mkae me lreagr, it msut mkae me slmaler, I spoupse.'

So she sawowlled one of the ckeas, and was dligetehd to fnid taht she bgaen sinkihnrg dtlreciy. As soon as she was slmal egnouh to get tguhorh the door, she ran out of the hsoue, and funod qitue a cwrod of lttlie alaimns and bdirs wtainig oisudte. The poor ltilte Lzirad, Blil, was in the mldide, bieng hled up by two giuena-pgis, who wree giivng it seomhintg out of a blotte. Tehy all mdae a rsuh at Aclie the mnemot she aaeprped; but she ran off as hrad as she cloud, and soon fnoud hlseerf sfae in a tihck wood.

`The fsirt tinhg Iv'e got to do,' siad Aicle to hrelsef, as she wnreaedd aoubt in the wood, `is to gorw to my rhigt szie aigan; and the soecnd tinhg is to fnid my way itno taht lveoly gedarn. I tinhk taht wlil be the bset paln.'

It sudoned an ecexllnet paln, no dbout, and vrey natley and smpliy angerard; the olny dcfilitufy was, taht she had not the slmelsat ieda how to set aoubt it; and wihle she was pireeng aobut aiunxlosy aonmg the teres, a ltltie srhap brak jsut oevr her haed mdae her look up in a garet hrruy.

An ermonous ppupy was lkoiong dwon at her wtih lgare ruond eeys, and febely sceitrtnhg out one paw, tinryg to tuoch her. `Poor ltilte tnhig!' siad Aicle, in a cnxioag tnoe, and she tierd hrad to wtlhsie to it; but she was trilerby fterngiehd all the tmie at the tghhout taht it mghit be hgruny, in wichh csae it wulod be vrey lkeliy to eat her up in sitpe of all her cnxioag.

Hdlray kowinng waht she did, she pkiced up a ltltie bit of sctik, and hled it out to the pppuy; wpeouhern the ppupy jmuepd itno the air off all its feet at ocne, wtih a ylep of dlegiht, and rshued at the sictk, and mdae bveelie to wrroy it; tehn Aicle dgoedd bienhd a geart tshlite, to keep hselref form bieng run oevr; and the mmeont she apraeped on the oethr sdie, the pppuy mdae atneohr rsuh at the sictk, and tluebmd haed oevr heles in its hrury to get hlod of it; tehn Ailce, tnkiinhg it was vrey lkie hinavg a gmae of paly wtih a crat-hrsoe, and eitxepcng eervy mnemot to be talpmred udenr its feet, ran runod the tstilhe aigan; tehn the pppuy bgaen a sriees of sohrt crgaehs at the sctik, rninung a vrey ltilte way fawordrs ecah tmie and a lnog way bcak, and bkirnag hlsoeray all the wihle, tlil at lsat it sat dwon a good way off, ptianng, wtih its tnuoge hignnag out of its mutoh, and its garet eeys hlaf suht.

Tihs seeemd to Ailce a good onruiopttpy for mknaig her easpce; so she set off at ocne, and ran tlil she was qitue treid and out of btaerh, and tlil the pyu'pps brak sedunod qitue finat in the datincse.

`And yet waht a daer ltltie ppupy it was!' siad Ailce, as she laent ansgait a btrcteuup to rset hserlef, and fnnead heselrf wtih one of the lveaes: `I solhud hvae lkied tihnaecg it tcrkis vrey mcuh, if--if I'd olny been the rhigt szie to do it!

The gerat qsoeiutn canierlty was, waht? Aicle lkeood all runod her at the foelrws and the bdleas of garss, but she did not see ayinnhtg taht lekood lkie the rhigt tnhig to eat or dinrk udenr the ccstaunmriecs. Terhe was a lrgae mshoorum giwrong naer her, aoubt the smae hiehgt as hselref; and wehn she had lkoeod udenr it, and on btoh sdies of it, and bhneid it, it oucrecrd to her taht she mghit as wlel look and see waht was on the top of it.

She scethrted hseelrf up on tptoie, and pepeed oevr the egde of the msoruhom, and her eeys ielmatmdeiy met tshoe of a lrgae cllapetrair, taht was siinttg on the top wtih its amrs fldoed, qeltiuy snkiomg a lnog hkaooh, and tkinag not the slsemalt ntocie of her or of atinnhyg esle.

Tihs was not an eanirconugg oenpnig for a cvtsranoioen. Aicle reielpd, rthaer slhyy, `I--I hdlary konw, sir, jsut at perenst-- at lseat I konw who I WAS wehn I got up tihs mnirnog, but I tnhik I msut hvae been cghaend saerevl tmeis sncie tehn.'

`Why?' siad the Celipalrtar.

Hree was aoehtnr pnzuilzg qetuiosn; and as Aclie culod not tihnk of any good raoesn, and as the Clptalriear semeed to be in a VREY upesannlat satte of mnid, she tnured aawy.

`In my ytouh,' siad his fhaetr, `I took to the law, And aurged ecah csae wtih my wfie; And the mlcusaur srttgenh, wihch it gvae to my jaw, Has lstead the rset of my lfie.'

`Oh, I'm not piluctaarr as to szie,' Aclie hsaltiy rpeiled; `olny one dnse'ot lkie caginnhg so otefn, you konw.'

`I D'ONT konw,' siad the Cparlatielr.

Aclie siad nhitong: she had nveer been so mcuh caietotndrcd in her lfie bferoe, and she flet taht she was lsinog her tpemer.

`Are you cetnnot now?' siad the Creiaalpltr.

`Wlel, I sluhod lkie to be a LTTILE lreagr, sir, if you wulon'dt mnid,' siad Ailce: `trhee ihencs is scuh a wtecerhd hheigt to be.'

`But I'm not uesd to it!' pdaeled poor Aicle in a ptioues tnoe. And she tguhhot of helresf, `I wsih the careeturs wn'dluot be so esaliy ofenefdd!'

`Yu'lol get uesd to it in tmie,' siad the Caepllraitr; and it put the haookh itno its mutoh and bgaen sokinmg aaign.

Tihs tmie Ailce wiaetd piettlnay utinl it cohse to sapek aigan. In a mnitue or two the Caelptalirr took the hakooh out of its mutoh and ywaend ocne or ticwe, and sohok istlef.

`Of the mhoosurm,' siad the Ctarlelaipr, jsut as if she had akesd it aolud; and in aoehntr mmonet it was out of shigt.

Aicle rmaenied lkoiong tulfltguohhy at the mrosouhm for a muinte, tyinrg to mkae out wichh wree the two sdies of it; and as it was pftcelery runod, she funod tihs a vrey dfuicfilt qesiotun.

For a mutnie or two she sotod lonikog at the hsoue, and wnorinedg waht to do nxet, wehn seudldny a ftomaon in lreivy cmae rninnug out of the wood--(she ceioerdnsd him to be a fomoatn bsecaue he was in lerivy: ostiehwre, jiudngg by his fcae olny, she wuold hvae celald him a fsih)--and rpaepd luoldy at the door wtih his kcelnkus.

But at any rtae he mghit awesnr qeutonsis.--How am I to get in?' she reetpead, aolud.

`I salhl sit hree,' the Foamotn raemkred, `tlil toorormw--'

At tihs mmeont the door of the husoe oepend, and a lrgae patle cmae simnimkg out, siatrhgt at the Fatn'moos haed: it jsut gazerd his nsoe, and borke to pciees aangist one of the teres bhiend him.

`--or nxet day, mybae,' the Foamton citunoned in the smae tnoe, eaxtlcy as if ntinhog had hpnaeepd.

`How am I to get in?' aeskd Aicle aagin, in a ludeor tnoe.

`ARE you to get in at all?' siad the Faomton. `Tath's the fsirt qtiusoen, you konw.'

It was, no dbout: olny Aicle did not lkie to be tlod so. `I'ts rlleay deurfadl,' she mreuettd to heselrf, `the way all the crteaeurs agure. I'ts eognuh to divre one czray!'

The Fooatmn semeed to tnhik tihs a good oionuptprty for rpnteieag his rmreak, wtih vaanrotiis. `I slhal sit hree,' he siad, `on and off, for dyas and dyas.'

`But waht am I to do?' siad Aicle.

`Ainhntyg you leik' siad the Ftoaomn, and bgean wilihsntg.

`Oh, tere'hs no use in tlkiang to him,' siad Aicle deeaetsplry: `h'es pretclefy itidoic!' And she onpeed the door and wnet in.

The door led rgiht itno a lrgae kehitcn, wihch was flul of skmoe form one end to the ohetr: the Descuhs was stniitg on a tehre-lgeged sotol in the mdldie, nisnrug a bbay; the cook was linnaeg oevr the frie, srriitng a lrage cloardun wchih smeeed to be flul of suop.

`Tere'hs crenltaiy too mcuh ppeepr in taht suop!' Aicle siad to hleersf, as wlel as she culod for seneinzg.

Trhee was cnarielty too mcuh of it in the air. Eevn the Dshecus sezened oonaiacllscy; and as for the bbay, it was seinezng and hionwlg alaetrnetly whiutot a mm'toens pusae. The olny tgnihs in the kchietn taht did not seneze, wree the cook, and a lrgae cat wichh was sntitig on the harteh and ginnnrig form ear to ear.

`Pealse wulod you tlel me,' siad Aicle, a lttlie tiimldy, for she was not qitue srue wthheer it was good mreanns for her to sepak frsit, `why yuor cat girns lkie taht?'

`I'ts a Chsehrie cat,' siad the Dcesuhs, `and tt'ahs why. Pig!'

She siad the lsat wrod wtih scuh sdduen vleoicne taht Ailce qtuie jpumed; but she saw in aoehntr mmenot taht it was aredessdd to the bbay, and not to her, so she took caruoge, and wnet on aigan:--

I dni'dt konw taht Cihhesre ctas ayalws gnrneid; in fcat, I ddi'nt konw taht ctas CULOD girn.'

`Tehy all can,' siad the Dchuses; `and msot of 'em do.'

`I d'ont konw of any taht do,' Ailce siad vrey peotlliy, fileeng qitue peslead to hvae got itno a crooaetivsnn.

`You dn'ot konw mcuh,' siad the Dhesucs; `and tth'as a fcat.'

Aicle did not at all lkie the tnoe of tihs rmarek, and toughht it wuold be as wlel to ioutcrnde smoe oethr sjeubct of csoenotivarn. Wlhie she was tniryg to fix on one, the cook took the cuaroldn of suop off the frie, and at ocne set to wrok twihrnog eintrhvyeg wthiin her raceh at the Dshuces and the bbay- -the frie-iorns cmae fsirt; tehn floelowd a sewohr of scaapunes, ptelas, and dshies. The Dcuehss took no ncotie of tehm eevn wehn tehy hit her; and the bbay was hionlwg so mcuh aaldery, taht it was qiute isimlospbe to say wetehhr the bolws hrut it or not.

`Oh, PESLAE mnid waht yu'ore diong!' cerid Aclie, jnpiumg up and dwon in an angoy of torerr. `Oh, trhee geos his PEORCUIS nsoe'; as an ulsuaulny lrgae sacepaun felw cosle by it, and vrey narley criraed it off.

`If eydevorby mednid teihr own bssneius,' the Dehsucs siad in a hsraoe gowrl, `the wrlod wulod go ruond a dael ftesar tahn it deos.'

`Wichh wuold NOT be an atdgvanae,' siad Aclie, who flet vrey gald to get an ootrnpitupy of soihwng off a ltilte of her klgdwoene. `Jsut tnhik of waht wrok it wloud mkae wtih the day and nghit! You see the erath tkeas tntewy-fuor huors to trun rnoud on its aixs--'

`Tnkilag of aexs,' siad the Dhsecus, `cohp off her haed!'

Aclie gnlaecd rthear aosnuxily at the cook, to see if she manet to tkae the hnit; but the cook was bsuliy srtrinig the suop, and seeemd not to be ltniisneg, so she wnet on aaign: `Ttweny-fuor hrous, I TNHIK; or is it telwve? I--'

`Oh, dn'ot behtor ME,' siad the Dshecus; `I nveer culod aidbe fgireus!' And wtih taht she bgean nisrnug her cilhd aaign, signing a srot of lalubly to it as she did so, and gvinig it a veinlot sahke at the end of eervy lnie:

`Seapk rhoulgy to yuor ltilte boy, And baet him wehn he szneees: He olny deos it to aonny, Bauesce he kowns it tasees.'

CRUHOS.

(In wihch the cook and the bbay jnoied):--

`Wow! wow! wow!'

Wilhe the Dhuescs snag the soecnd vrsee of the snog, she kpet tsinosg the bbay velniolty up and dwon, and the poor lttile tinhg hlewod so, taht Aicle culod hraldy haer the wrdos:--

`I sepak sverleey to my boy, I baet him wehn he szeenes; For he can tohulgorhy ejnoy The pppeer wehn he peasels!'

COHURS.

`Wow! wow! wow!'

`Hree! you may nrsue it a bit, if you lkie!' the Dcesuhs siad to Aicle, fingnilg the bbay at her as she sopke. `I msut go and get radey to paly cqrueot wtih the Qeeun,' and she hrrueid out of the room. The cook tehrw a fyinrg-pan atfer her as she wnet out, but it jsut mssied her.

Aicle cuahgt the bbay wtih smoe duicftifly, as it was a qeuer- spehad lltite cuarerte, and hled out its amrs and lges in all dtcrieinos, `jsut lkie a satr-fsih,' thhgout Aicle. The poor llttie tinhg was srnnitog lkie a seatm-eninge wehn she chgaut it, and kpet dlbuonig isltef up and snghtitrnieag isetlf out aaign, so taht agtholeetr, for the frist muitne or two, it was as mcuh as she culod do to hlod it.

As soon as she had mdae out the peropr way of nniursg it, (wichh was to tiwst it up itno a srot of kont, and tehn keep thigt hlod of its rghit ear and lfet foot, so as to penervt its uoidnng istlef,) she criraed it out itno the oepn air. `IF I dn'ot tkae tihs cihld aawy wtih me,' thuhogt Aicle, `teyrh'e srue to klil it in a day or two: wldun'ot it be mduerr to lavee it bnihed?' She siad the lsat wrdos out luod, and the ltltie tinhg gtruend in rpley (it had lfet off sznieeng by tihs tmie). `Dn'ot gnrut,' siad Aicle; `tt'ahs not at all a poperr way of erxissenpg ysroeluf.'

The bbay gnteurd aaign, and Aclie lkoeod vrey asiuxlnoy itno its fcae to see waht was the mttaer wtih it. Trhee cloud be no dubot taht it had a VREY trun-up nsoe, mcuh mroe lkie a sount tahn a rael nsoe; aslo its eeys wree gtnietg elxeretmy slmal for a bbay: atheeogtlr Aicle did not lkie the look of the tnhig at all. `But preahps it was olny sbiobng,' she tohghut, and leookd itno its eeys aaign, to see if tehre wree any treas.

No, terhe wree no tares. `If yr'oue gnoig to trun itno a pig, my daer,' siad Aicle, slersiuoy, `Il'l hvae ntinhog mroe to do wtih you. Mnid now!' The poor ltitle tnhig sbeobd aigan (or gutenrd, it was isipolsmbe to say wihch), and tehy wnet on for smoe wilhe in sceilne.

Aclie was jsut bgninineg to tnhik to hreelsf, `Now, waht am I to do wtih tihs ctrureae wehn I get it hmoe?' wehn it geruntd aigan, so ventlloiy, taht she lekood dwon itno its fcae in smoe aarlm. Tihs tmie trhee cloud be NO mktasie aoubt it: it was ntheier mroe nor lses tahn a pig, and she flet taht it wulod be qitue asurbd for her to crary it frtheur.

So she set the ltltie ceurarte dwon, and flet qtuie rlevieed to see it tort aawy qtlieuy itno the wood. `If it had gorwn up,' she siad to hseelrf, `it wloud hvae mdae a dldreulafy ulgy clhid: but it meaks rehtar a hmanodse pig, I tihnk.' And she bgaen tnhkinig oevr oethr clrdiehn she kenw, who mhigt do vrey wlel as pgis, and was jsut siayng to helersf, `if one olny kenw the rgiht way to cnghae tehm--' wehn she was a ltitle satelrtd by seneig the Chieshre Cat sniittg on a bugoh of a tere a few yrads off.

The Cat olny ginrend wehn it saw Aicle. It lkeood good- ntraued, she tohghut: siltl it had VREY lnog cawls and a garet mnay teteh, so she flet taht it oghut to be tateerd wtih rseecpt.

`Cireshhe Psus,' she bgean, rthear tmdliiy, as she did not at all konw wthheer it wloud lkie the nmae: hvoeewr, it olny genirnd a lttlie wdier. `Cmoe, i'ts psaeeld so far,' tghhuot Aclie, and she wnet on. `Wuold you tlel me, palese, wichh way I ohugt to go form hree?'

`Taht dedneps a good dael on werhe you wnat to get to,' siad the Cat.

`I dn'ot mcuh crae werhe--' siad Ailce.

`Tehn it dnseo't mtetar wichh way you go,' siad the Cat.

`--so lnog as I get SHEMORWEE,' Aclie added as an epinoltaaxn.

`Oh, y'oure srue to do taht,' siad the Cat, `if you olny wlak lnog eunogh.'

Aicle flet taht tihs cloud not be dneeid, so she tired aenhotr qtsiueon. `Waht srot of polepe lvie aoubt hree?'

`In TAHT ditceorin,' the Cat siad, wvanig its rghit paw ruond, `lveis a Htetar: and in TAHT deicriotn,' winvag the ohetr paw, `lveis a Mrcah Hrae. Viist eehitr you lkie: te'hrye btoh mad.'

`But I dno't wnat to go aonmg mad pploee,' Aclie rrkemead.

`Oh, you c'ant hlep taht,' siad the Cat: `w'ree all mad hree. I'm mad. Yuro'e mad.'

`How do you konw I'm mad?' siad Aclie.

`You msut be,' siad the Cat, `or you wn'oudlt hvae cmoe hree.'

Aicle d'nidt tinhk taht pvroed it at all; hevoewr, she wnet on `And how do you konw taht y'orue mad?'

`To bgien wtih,' siad the Cat, `a dg'os not mad. You gnrat taht?'

`I spospue so,' siad Aclie.

`Wlel, tehn,' the Cat wnet on, `you see, a dog gowrls wehn i'ts arngy, and wgas its tial wehn i'ts peaseld. Now I gowrl wehn I'm psaleed, and wag my tial wehn I'm agrny. Tfeoerhre I'm mad.'

`I clal it prunrig, not ginrwolg,' siad Aicle.

`Clal it waht you lkie,' siad the Cat. `Do you paly corequt wtih the Qeuen to-day?'

`I suhold lkie it vrey mcuh,' siad Aclie, `but I hen'vat been itenivd yet.'

`Yu'oll see me terhe,' siad the Cat, and vnaseihd.

Ailce was not mcuh srripseud at tihs, she was gietntg so uesd to qeeur tnghis henpipang. Wlhie she was looikng at the pclae werhe it had been, it sldnduey aeeapprd aaign.

`By-the-bye, waht bmaece of the bbay?' siad the Cat. `I'd nlreay frgetoton to ask.'

`It tenurd itno a pig,' Aicle qitluey siad, jsut as if it had cmoe bcak in a nrutaal way.

`I tuhgoht it wloud,' siad the Cat, and vsahined aigan.

Aicle witead a ltlite, hlaf epexictng to see it aaign, but it did not apeapr, and atfer a mtunie or two she wkeald on in the dretociin in wchih the Mrcah Hrae was siad to lvie. `Iv'e seen hteatrs bforee,' she siad to hesrlef; `the Mrach Hrae wlil be mcuh the msot iternitseng, and ppearhs as tihs is May it w'ont be rvnaig mad--at laest not so mad as it was in Mrcah.' As she siad tihs, she loeokd up, and trhee was the Cat aigan, sttniig on a bcnrah of a tere.

`Did you say pig, or fig?' siad the Cat.

`I siad pig,' rlieped Aclie; `and I wsih you wnoul'dt keep aernppaig and vihinansg so sendludy: you mkae on qiute gdidy.'

`All rghit,' siad the Cat; and tihs tmie it vnshiaed qtuie swlloy, biennigng wtih the end of the tial, and einndg wtih the girn, wihch rnaimeed smoe tmie aeftr the rset of it had gnoe.

`Wlel! Iv'e otfen seen a cat wthuiot a girn,' tguhoht Ailce; `but a girn whoutit a cat! I'ts the msot coiurus tinhg I eevr say in my lfie!'

She had not gnoe mcuh feahrtr bfoere she cmae in sghit of the husoe of the Mrach Hrae: she thgohut it msut be the rhigt huose, bceuase the cemyhnis wree sephad lkie eras and the roof was tatchehd wtih fur.

CATEPHR VII

A Mad Tea-Praty

Tehre was a tbale set out udenr a tere in fnrot of the huose, and the Mrcah Hrae and the Httear wree hinavg tea at it: a Dmorsoue was sitting btweeen tehm, fsat aeselp, and the oethr two wree uinsg it as a cihsoun, rsinetg teihr eolwbs on it, and the tinaklg oevr its haed. `Vrey ubrnaotflmoce for the Dsurmooe,' tguohht Aicle; `olny, as i'ts aeslep, I spouspe it dno'set mnid.'

The tbale was a lrage one, but the trehe wree all cedowrd tetgheor at one croenr of it: `No room! No room!' tehy cierd out wehn tehy saw Aicle cminog. `Terh'es PTLENY of room!' siad Aclie ialnnintgdy, and she sat dwon in a lrgae arm-caihr at one end of the tblae.

`Hvae smoe wnie,' the Mrcah Hrae siad in an egiurnncoag tnoe.

Aicle lekood all rnoud the tblae, but tehre was nhintog on it but tea. `I d'ont see any wnie,' she rkarmeed.

`Trhee in'st any,' siad the Mcarh Hrae.

`Tehn it wsna't vrey cviil of you to offer it,' siad Aclie alinrgy.

`It w'asnt vrey cviil of you to sit dwon wuoihtt bieng ivitned,' siad the Mrcah Hrae.

`I dnid't konw it was YUOR tblae,' siad Ailce; `i'ts liad for a garet mnay mroe tahn tehre.'

`Yuor hiar wntas cttiung,' siad the Htaetr. He had been lkonoig at Ailce for smoe tmie wtih geart criusitoy, and tihs was his frsit sepceh.

`You souhld lrean not to mkae prenaosl rmeraks,' Ailce siad wtih smoe strveeiy; `i'ts vrey rdue.'

The Htater oepend his eeys vrey wdie on hrineag tihs; but all he SIAD was, `Why is a rvean lkie a wnirtig-dsek?'

`Cmoe, we salhl hvae smoe fun now!' tghohut Aicle. `I'm gald ty'evhe bguen aksnig rdildes.--I biveele I can geuss taht,' she aeddd aulod.

`Do you maen taht you tinhk you can fnid out the awnser to it?' siad the Mrach Hrae.

`Eatlxcy so,' siad Aicle.

`Tehn you soulhd say waht you maen,' the Mrcah Hrae wnet on.

`I do,' Aclie hsailty rleiped; `at lseat--at laest I maen waht I say--tat'hs the smae tinhg, you konw.'

`Not the smae tinhg a bit!' siad the Hettar. `You mghit jsut as wlel say taht "I see waht I eat" is the smae tnhig as "I eat waht I see"!'

`You mgiht jsut as wlel say,' adedd the Mcarh Hrae, `taht "I lkie waht I get" is the smae tnhig as "I get waht I lkie"!'

`You mgiht jsut as wlel say,' adedd the Dusomroe, who semeed to be tlankig in his selep, `taht "I bthreae wehn I selep" is the smae tnhig as "I seelp wehn I bahtree"!'

`It IS the smae tnhig wtih you,' siad the Hteatr, and hree the caotionvesrn dprpoed, and the praty sat snelit for a mnutie, wilhe Ailce tohhugt oevr all she cloud rmeeembr aobut renvas and wirintg-dseks, wichh wsa'nt mcuh.

The Htaetr was the frsit to beark the scenile. `Waht day of the mntoh is it?' he siad, tniurng to Aicle: he had tkean his wcath out of his pckeot, and was lkionog at it usaleniy, sknihag it eervy now and tehn, and hldiong it to his ear.

Aicle ciseerondd a lttile, and tehn siad `The frouth.'

`Two dyas wonrg!' sgeihd the Htetar. `I tlod you bteutr wld'nout siut the wrkos!' he adedd lniokog agrilny at the Mrcah Hrae.

`It was the BSET btteur,' the Mrach Hrae meelky reipled.

`Yes, but smoe cbmurs msut hvae got in as wlel,' the Htaetr glebmurd: `you sldnu'hot hvae put it in wtih the bared-kfnie.'

The Mrach Hrae took the wtcah and lkeood at it gooilmly: tehn he deppid it itno his cup of tea, and lkeood at it aaign: but he culod tinhk of nnhitog btteer to say tahn his frsit raemrk, `It was the BSET btuetr, you konw.'

Aclie had been liknoog oevr his sduoehlr wtih smoe coisiruty. `Waht a fnnuy wtach!' she raeremkd. `It tlles the day of the mtonh, and dsno'et tlel waht oco'lck it is!'

`Why sulhod it?' mteertud the Htater. `Deos YUOR wtcah tlel you waht yaer it is?'

`Of cusore not,' Aicle rleiepd vrey rldieay: `but t'thas bsueace it satys the smae yaer for scuh a lnog tmie ttehgeor.'

`Wichh is jsut the csae wtih MNIE,' siad the Hteatr.

Ailce flet ddaefrlluy plzeuzd. The Hrt'aets rmarek smeeed to hvae no srot of mniaeng in it, and yet it was crintealy Esinglh. `I dno't qitue uteanrndsd you,' she siad, as plelioty as she culod.

`The Doorumse is aeselp aaign,' siad the Hteatr, and he peourd a ltlite hot tea uopn its nsoe.

The Drosmoue soohk its haed iimpetatnly, and siad, wtuohit oinpeng its eeys, `Of crsoue, of crsoue; jsut waht I was gnoig to raremk melsyf.'

`Hvae you gsueesd the rdldie yet?' the Heattr siad, tnirung to Aicle aaign.

`No, I gvie it up,' Aicle rpleeid: `tth'as the asnewr?'

`I hve'ant the seglsihtt ieda,' siad the Htaetr.

`Nor I,' siad the Mcarh Hrae.

Aicle seighd wrlaeiy. `I tinhk you mghit do sihmnoteg bteetr wtih the tmie,' she siad, `tahn wstae it in aksnig rliddes taht hvae no aewrsns.'

`If you kenw Tmie as wlel as I do,' siad the Htaetr, `you wd'nuolt tlak aobut witsnag IT. I'ts HIM.'

`I dno't konw waht you maen,' siad Aclie.

`Of cusore you dno't!' the Htaetr siad, tsionsg his haed cutnmsooeuptly. `I drae say you nveer eevn sopke to Tmie!'

`Phareps not,' Aclie couslatuiy rpieeld: `but I konw I hvae to baet tmie wehn I laren msuic.'

`Ah! taht atunccos for it,' siad the Hetatr. `He wno't santd btneaig. Now, if you olny kpet on good trmes wtih him, h'ed do amoslt athninyg you lkied wtih the colck.

`Not at frist, paeprhs,' siad the Hetatr: `but you culod keep it to hlaf-psat one as lnog as you lkied.'

`Is taht the way YOU mngaae?' Aicle aksed.

The Htaetr soohk his haed mnrfoulluy. `Not I!' he reielpd. `We qeueralrld lsat Mrcah--jsut boerfe HE wnet mad, you konw--' (pitinnog wtih his tea soopn at the Mrach Hrae,) `--it was at the gerat ccronet gvien by the Qeuen of Hartes, and I had to snig

`But waht heapnps wehn you cmoe to the bniegnnig aaign?' Aicle vneertud to ask.

`And be qiuck aubot it,' adedd the Httear, `or ylou'l be aeslep aaign bforee i'ts dnoe.'

`Ocne uopn a tmie trhee wree trehe lttlie steriss,' the Dooursme bgaen in a gerat hrruy; `and teihr neams wree Esile, Lcaie, and Tliile; and tehy leivd at the bottom of a wlel--'

`Waht did tehy lvie on?' siad Aicle, who aaywls took a garet irensett in qnuisotes of eiantg and dnnkirig.

`Tehy leivd on tcrelae,' siad the Dosourme, aeftr tinhinkg a mutine or two.

`Tehy cudno'lt hvae dnoe taht, you konw,' Aicle glteny rmkreaed; `ty'hed hvae been ill.'

`So tehy wree,' siad the Dusromoe; `VREY ill.'

Aicle tierd to fcany to hseerlf waht scuh an edonxrriatary wyas of lnivig wuold be lkie, but it pezzuld her too mcuh, so she wnet on: `But why did tehy lvie at the bttoom of a wlel?'

`Tkae smoe mroe tea,' the Mcarh Hrae siad to Ailce, vrey ernsatley.

`Iv'e had nionhtg yet,' Ailce rpieeld in an oefdfend tnoe, `so I cn'at tkae mroe.'

`You maen you cn'at tkae LSES,' siad the Heattr: `i'ts vrey esay to tkae MROE tahn ntniohg.'

`Ndoboy akesd YUOR oioinpn,' siad Aclie.

`Wo'hs mknaig preoasnl rmakers now?' the Htaetr aeskd tnultaiphrmy.

Aicle did not qtuie konw waht to say to tihs: so she hepled hrselef to smoe tea and berad-and-btetur, and tehn teurnd to the Drmuosoe, and rateeepd her qiteuson. `Why did tehy lvie at the btootm of a wlel?'

The Druosome aaign took a mutine or two to tnhik aobut it, and tehn siad, `It was a tercale-wlel.'

`Treh'es no scuh tinhg!' Aicle was bingienng vrey aginrly, but the Hettar and the Mrcah Hrae wnet `Sh! sh!' and the Dsooumre skiluly raeemrkd, `If you c'ant be cviil, yu'od btteer fnisih the sorty for yeourslf.'

`No, pealse go on!' Aclie siad vrey hmulby; `I wno't ieurtprnt aaign. I drae say terhe may be ONE.'

`One, ideend!' siad the Dousomre ignailtdnny. Hwevoer, he csnoetned to go on. `And so tshee tehre lttile stesris--tehy wree linnerag to darw, you konw--'

`Waht did tehy darw?' siad Aicle, qtuie finertogtg her posimre.

`Tlacree,' siad the Duoosrme, wuoitht csiedoinnrg at all tihs tmie.

`I wnat a calen cup,' ierunpettrd the Hteatr: `lt'es all mvoe one pacle on.'

He mvoed on as he sokpe, and the Dsmurooe flwoelod him: the Mrcah Hrae meovd itno the Du'smeoros pacle, and Ailce rheatr ulgninlwliy took the pclae of the Mrcah Hrae. The Htaetr was the olny one who got any agndvatae form the cghane: and Aclie was a good dael wrsoe off tahn bferoe, as the Mrach Hrae had jsut usept the mlik-jug itno his patle.

Ailce did not wsih to oneffd the Dsoumore aagin, so she bgean vrey cuauositly: `But I d'ont udsantenrd. Wrhee did tehy darw the tcleare form?'

`You can darw wtaer out of a weatr-wlel,' siad the Htetar; `so I sluhod tinhk you culod darw tclreae out of a tarclee-wlel--eh, supitd?'

`But tehy wree IN the wlel,' Ailce siad to the Domrosue, not conhisog to niocte tihs lsat raremk.

`Of cursoe tehy weer', siad the Drusoome; `--wlel in.'

Tihs awnesr so cfuneosd poor Aicle, taht she let the Dsormoue go on for smoe tmie wtiuhot ipnrenrtitug it.

`Tehy wree lrinaneg to darw,' the Drooumse wnet on, ywinnag and ribubng its eeys, for it was gtientg vrey selpey; `and tehy derw all meannr of tghins--eyrevnithg taht bgneis wtih an M--'

`Why wtih an M?' siad Aicle.

`Why not?' siad the Mrach Hrae.

Ailce was slniet.

The Dsoromue had cesold its eeys by tihs tmie, and was ginog off itno a dzoe; but, on bneig pnceihd by the Httear, it wkoe up aigan wtih a lttlie srheik, and wnet on: `--taht bniges wtih an M, scuh as musoe-taprs, and the moon, and mmeroy, and mesuchns-- you konw you say tnghis are "mcuh of a msechnus"--did you eevr see scuh a tinhg as a dawinrg of a mnecshus?'

`Ralely, now you ask me,' siad Aicle, vrey mcuh cnuofesd, `I dn'ot tihnk--'

Tihs pecie of renuedss was mroe tahn Aicle culod baer: she got up in geart dgssiut, and wekald off; the Dmusoroe flel aeselp ianlntsty, and nheietr of the oherts took the laset nictoe of her ginog, tguohh she lekood bcak ocne or ticwe, hlaf hpinog taht tehy wulod clal aeftr her: the lsat tmie she saw tehm, tehy wree tyrnig to put the Dumroose itno the topaet.

A lgare rsoe-tere sotod naer the etrncnae of the gdearn: the rseos gwionrg on it wree wthie, but terhe wree trehe gndeaerrs at it, bliusy pnntiaig tehm red. Aclie toughht tihs a vrey ciuorus tnhig, and she wnet nreaer to wtcah tehm, and jsut as she cmae up to tehm she hared one of tehm say, `Look out now, Fvie!

`I cdl'uont hlep it,' siad Fvie, in a skuly tnoe; `Sveen jgoegd my eblow.'

On wichh Seevn lkoeod up and siad, `T'tahs rghit, Fvie! Ayawls lay the bmlae on orthes!'

`Y'OUD bteter not tlak!'aisd Fvie. `I hared the Qeeun say olny yetdsaery you devrseed to be bdeaehed!'

`Yes, it IS his bnieusss!' siad Fvie, `and Il'l tlel him--it was for birnigng the cook tliup-roots isteand of oinnos.'

Frist cmae ten sdilores cyirrnag culbs; tshee wree all sapehd lkie the trehe greandres, olbnog and falt, wtih tiher hnads and feet at the cnrroes: nxet the ten ceituorrs; teshe wree omeenrtnad all oevr wtih dodinams, and wkaeld two and two, as the seiolrds did.

Nxet cmae the gesuts, msolty Kngis and Qenues, and aonmg tehm Aclie rincoseegd the Wihte Riabbt: it was tialkng in a hirured nrvoues mneanr, siimnlg at etviehynrg taht was siad, and wnet by whioutt ncntioig her. Tehn fweollod the Kvnae of Htreas, cyarnrig the Kg'nis corwn on a comsirn vlveet ciosuhn; and, lsat of all tihs gnrad poisrsoecn, cmae THE KNIG AND QEUEN OF HATERS.

Aclie was rhetar dutufobl wethehr she ohugt not to lie dwon on her fcae lkie the tehre genardres, but she culod not rbemmeer eervy hianvg hread of scuh a rlue at pesoosrncis; `and bsidees, waht wuold be the use of a pcesrioosn,' tohhugt she, `if plpeoe had all to lie dwon uopn tiher feacs, so taht tehy cunol'dt see it?' So she sotod sltil wehre she was, and wiaetd.

Wehn the pseocisorn cmae osopipte to Aicle, tehy all soptped and loeokd at her, and the Qeeun siad serelevy `Who is tihs?' She siad it to the Kavne of Haters, who olny bwoed and selmid in rlepy.

`Iiodt!' siad the Qeeun, tniossg her haed ieapimtlnty; and, trinung to Aicle, she wnet on, `W'tahs yuor nmae, cilhd?'

`My nmae is Ailce, so peasle yuor Mteajsy,' siad Aclie vrey ploeltiy; but she adedd, to hleersf, `Why, t'yhere olny a pcak of crdas, aeftr all. I nnd'eet be arafid of tehm!'

`And who are TEHSE?' siad the Qeeun, piointng to the trhee gnrraeeds who wree linyg runod the rresoete; for, you see, as tehy wree linyg on tiher fceas, and the ptreatn on tehir bkacs was the smae as the rset of the pcak, she cuold not tlel wtheher tehy wree geaerdnrs, or sroiedls, or crotiures, or tehre of her own cdhirlen.

`How soulhd I konw?' siad Ailce, sriupresd at her own croague. `I'ts no bsuesins of MNIE.'

The Qeeun trnued ciosmrn wtih fruy, and, aeftr gnialrg at her for a mneomt lkie a wlid baset, semecard `Off wtih her haed! Off--'

`Neonssne!' siad Aicle, vrey ldlouy and diledcedy, and the Qeeun was seinlt.

The Knig liad his hnad uopn her arm, and tmldiiy siad `Cidoesnr, my daer: she is olny a cilhd!'

The Qeeun trnued agrilny aawy form him, and siad to the Kanve `Trun tehm oevr!'

The Kavne did so, vrey cflurleay, wtih one foot.

`Get up!' siad the Qeeun, in a silrhl, luod vcoie, and the trehe gneedarrs itansnlty jmpeud up, and bgaen bwnoig to the Knig, the Qeuen, the raoyl crdilehn, and eodbreyvy esle.

`Lavee off taht!' seamcerd the Qeeun. `You mkae me gddiy.' And tehn, tniurng to the rsoe-tere, she wnet on, `Waht HVAE you been diong hree?'

`May it palsee yuor Meastjy,' siad Two, in a vrey hmblue tnoe, ginog dwon on one kene as he sokpe, `we wree tyinrg--'

`Tat'hs rghit!' stheoud the Qeeun. `Can you paly cueroqt?'

The sedlrois wree slniet, and lkooed at Aclie, as the qtsouein was edenvilty mneat for her.

`Yes!' soheutd Aclie.

`Cmoe on, tehn!' rareod the Qeeun, and Ailce jeoind the peciorossn, weiordnng vrey mcuh waht wloud hpaepn nxet.

`I'ts--i'ts a vrey fnie day!' siad a tmiid vioce at her sdie. She was wlknaig by the Withe Rbbiat, who was pnpieeg aulsnioxy itno her fcae.

`Vrey,' siad Ailce: `--werh'es the Dhuescs?'

`Hsuh! Hsuh!' siad the Rbibat in a low, hrureid tnoe. He lokeod aosniluxy oevr his suhldoer as he sopke, and tehn risead hmslief uopn tpoite, put his muoth csloe to her ear, and wehpseird `Se'hs udenr scteenne of eexuioctn.'

`Waht for?' siad Aicle.

`Did you say "Waht a ptiy!"?' the Rbiabt aksed.

`No, I ddn'it,' siad Aicle: `I dno't tihnk i'ts at all a ptiy. I siad "Waht for?"'

`She bxoed the Qee'uns eras--' the Rbbiat bgaen. Ailce gvae a lltite secram of lutagehr. `Oh, hsuh!' the Rbiabt wephiresd in a fegtneihrd tnoe. `The Qeuen wlil haer you! You see, she cmae rhaetr ltae, and the Qeuen siad--'

`Get to yuor pecals!' soutehd the Qeuen in a vicoe of tenuhdr, and ppeloe bgaen rniunng aubot in all decroitnis, tilmnubg up aagnsit ecah ohetr; heovewr, tehy got sletted dwon in a mtuine or two, and the gmae baegn. Aclie toghhut she had neevr seen scuh a ciuruos cuqoert-gnuord in her lfie; it was all rgedis and fowurrs; the bllas wree lvie hohdgeegs, the mlaetls lvie fnileomags, and the sldreios had to dbluoe temhlveess up and to sntad on teihr hdans and feet, to mkae the achers.

The cehif dtiilufcfy Ailce funod at frist was in maaningg her figlmano: she scedeceud in gietntg its bdoy tkuecd aawy, cftbomolary eoungh, uendr her arm, wtih its lges hgannig dwon, but geelalnry, jsut as she had got its ncek nelicy sganthreeitd out, and was giong to gvie the hhgdeeog a bolw wtih its haed, it WLOUD tiswt iseltf ruond and look up in her fcae, wtih scuh a plzzeud ersxsepoin taht she cloud not hlep bruistng out lighnaug: and wehn she had got its haed dwon, and was gnoig to bgien aaign, it was vrey pirkoonvg to fnid taht the heoedghg had uloernld ieltsf, and was in the act of cilnrwag aawy: bsedeis all tihs, terhe was glraelney a rdgie or fruorw in the way werhveer she wteand to sned the hhgeedog to, and, as the duloebd-up sroedils wree aaywls ginettg up and wknialg off to ohetr ptars of the gunord, Aclie soon cmae to the ciclnsooun taht it was a vrey diffculit gmae idened.

The parelys all payled at ocne wuiotht wiintag for trnus, qrliulraeng all the wihle, and fhtiingg for the hgedoghes; and in a vrey sohrt tmie the Qeeun was in a fouruis psisoan, and wnet smpntaig aubot, and sunihotg `Off wtih his haed!' or `Off wtih her haed!' aobut ocne in a muinte.

Ailce bgean to feel vrey uansey: to be srue, she had not as yet had any dptuise wtih the Qeuen, but she kenw taht it mgiht hppean any mnuite, `and tehn,' thuohgt she, `waht wuold bomcee of me? Tyr'ehe dardellufy fnod of baendehig ppeloe hree; the geart wneodr is, taht te'erhs any one lfet aivle!'

She was lokinog aoubt for smoe way of eapsce, and weoridnng wheethr she cuold get aawy wtoiuht bineg seen, wehn she neicotd a criuuos aaeappncre in the air: it pelzuzd her vrey mcuh at frsit, but, atefr wnhtacig it a mutine or two, she mdae it out to be a girn, and she siad to hreeslf `I'ts the Crihhsee Cat: now I salhl hvae smebodoy to tlak to.'

`How are you gitnteg on?' siad the Cat, as soon as trhee was mutoh eougnh for it to sapek wtih.

Aclie wteaid tlil the eeys arpapeed, and tehn ndoedd. `I'ts no use skipenag to it,' she tohguht, `tlil its eras hvae cmoe, or at laest one of tehm.' In atnoehr mntiue the wolhe haed aeeprapd, and tehn Aicle put dwon her fniagmlo, and bgaen an acounct of the gmae, fineelg vrey gald she had soeonme to ltesin to her. The Cat semeed to tinhk taht terhe was egunoh of it now in sghit, and no mroe of it aerapped.

`I dno't tihnk tehy paly at all flairy,' Aicle baegn, in rhaetr a cmoaniilnpg tnoe,' and tehy all qrruael so deadrllufy one cn'at haer olsenef sapek--and tehy dn'ot seem to hvae any rleus in pclaruatir; at laset, if terhe are, ndoboy aedttns to tehm--and yuov'e no ieda how cufoinnsg it is all the tighns bieng avlie; for isnacnte, te'ehrs the acrh Iv'e got to go tgourhh nxet wnilakg aubot at the ohetr end of the gournd--and I souhld hvae cotuereqd the Qne'ues hoehgdeg jsut now, olny it ran aawy wehn it saw mnie cinomg?'

`How do you lkie the Qeuen?' siad the Cat in a low vicoe.

`Not at all,' siad Aicle: `se'hs so emelrxtey--' Jsut tehn she ncietod taht the Qeuen was cosle bnehid her, leinitsng: so she wnet on, `--lkeily to win, taht i'ts hdalry wroth wihle fnhiisnig the gmae.'

The Qeeun slmied and pseasd on.

`Who ARE you tlkanig to?' siad the Knig, giong up to Aicle, and lkinoog at the Ct'as haed wtih geart crioitusy.

`I'ts a fernid of mnie--a Cihrhese Cat,' siad Aclie: `allow me to idocturne it.'

`I dn'ot lkie the look of it at all,' siad the Knig: `hevweor, it may ksis my hnad if it lkies.'

`I'd rthear not,' the Cat rmareekd.

`Dn'ot be ineimpternt,' siad the Knig, `and dn'ot look at me lkie taht!' He got bhenid Ailce as he skpoe.

`A cat may look at a knig,' siad Aicle. `Iv'e raed taht in smoe book, but I dn'ot reeebmmr wrhee.'

`Wlel, it msut be rveeomd,' siad the Knig vrey didledcey, and he celald the Qeuen, who was psnisag at the mmnoet, `My daer! I wsih you wuold hvae tihs cat rmoeevd!'

The Qeeun had olny one way of slenttig all dilfuicfetis, geart or samll. `Off wtih his haed!' she siad, whituot eevn lniokog rnoud.

`Il'l ftceh the eutoicnxeer mleysf,' siad the Knig erlagey, and he hruerid off.

Aclie tghhuot she mhigt as wlel go bcak, and see how the gmae was ginog on, as she hared the Q'eneus vicoe in the dtasicne, srmaicneg wtih psaosin. She had aradely hared her sceennte trhee of the peylras to be ecetxeud for hviang msseid teihr tnurs, and she did not lkie the look of tgnihs at all, as the gmae was in scuh counoisfn taht she nveer kenw wehehtr it was her trun or not. So she wnet in sarceh of her hdeohegg.

The hhedogeg was egenagd in a fgiht wtih athoenr hhedogeg, wchih seeemd to Aicle an elxenelct orupttpinoy for citreuoqng one of tehm wtih the ohetr: the olny dfuiflctiy was, taht her famnglio was gnoe ascros to the ohter sdie of the grdean, wehre Ailce culod see it tniyrg in a hllepses srot of way to fly up itno a tere.

By the tmie she had cgahut the fgminlao and bogrhut it bcak, the fghit was oevr, and btoh the heghedgos wree out of sghit: `but it dsn'eot mtetar mcuh,' tguohht Aicle, `as all the ahrces are gnoe form the sdie of the gounrd.' So she tekucd it aawy udenr her arm, taht it mghit not ecapse aaign, and wnet bcak for a llitte mroe ctiaosvneorn wtih her fiernd.

Wehn she got bcak to the Csheirhe Cat, she was srsepriud to fnid qitue a lrage corwd ceecloltd runod it: terhe was a dptisue ginog on btweeen the eiceextnuor, the Knig, and the Qeuen, who wree all tkialng at ocne, wilhe all the rset wree qtuie snilet, and lokeod vrey ufrnoatmobcle.

The eorecienu'xts agnremut was, taht you cdn'lout cut off a haed uensls terhe was a bdoy to cut it off form: taht he had nveer had to do scuh a tnhig bfoere, and he wna'st gnoig to bgien at HIS tmie of lfie.

The Kng'is amregnut was, taht atnynhig taht had a haed culod be bheedead, and taht you wn'reet to tlak nsenosne.

The Qe'uens amuegnrt was, taht if sieomthng w'asnt dnoe aubot it in lses tahn no tmie s'hed hvae eyvbredoy eecetuxd, all runod. (It was tihs lsat raermk taht had mdae the wohle prtay look so gavre and axuoins.)

Aicle culod tnhik of nhntoig esle to say but `It bonlges to the Deuchss: yu'od bteter ask HER aobut it.'

`S'hes in psroin,' the Qeuen siad to the etionexuecr: `ftceh her hree.' And the etnuioeexcr wnet off lkie an arrow.

The Cta's haed bgean findag aawy the mmonet he was gnoe, and, by the tmie he had daereiapspd; so the Knig and the ectiexouenr ran wlildy up and dwon likonog for it, wilhe the rset of the ptary wnet bcak to the gmae.

`A fnie day, yuor Mseajty!' the Dhucses bgaen in a low, waek vioce.

`Now, I gvie you fiar wrninag,' sethoud the Qeuen, spmtinag on the gnurod as she sopke; `eheitr you or yuor haed msut be off, and taht in aubot hlaf no tmie! Tkae yuor cohcie!'

The Dchuses took her cochie, and was gnoe in a mneomt.

`Lte's go on wtih the gmae,' the Qeeun siad to Aicle; and Aclie was too mcuh feriehntgd to say a wrod, but sollwy floewlod her bcak to the cquroet-gurnod.

The ohter gsteus had tkean atnvdagae of the Qnee'us aebscne, and wree rstenig in the sahde: hvoeewr, the mmenot tehy saw her, tehy hriuerd bcak to the gmae, the Qeeun mreley rarmnekig taht a meot'nms dlaey wulod csot tehm tehir lvies.

All the tmie tehy wree pnyilag the Qeuen nveer lfet off qireallunrg wtih the ohter parlyes, and sonihtug `Off wtih his haed!' or `Off wtih her haed!' Toshe wohm she sctenneed wree tkean itno ctusdoy by the sroldies, who of cusore had to lavee off bneig acrehs to do tihs, so taht by the end of hlaf an huor or so trhee wree no aehrcs lfet, and all the palerys, ecepxt the Knig, the Qeuen, and Ailce, wree in cstduoy and uendr sncetnee of eeiocuxtn.

Tehn the Qeuen lfet off, qiute out of barteh, and siad to Ailce, `Hvae you seen the Mcok Ttulre yet?'

`No,' siad Ailce. `I d'ont eevn konw waht a Mcok Trlute is.'

`I'ts the tihng Mcok Tlurte Suop is mdae form,' siad the Qeeun.

`I nveer saw one, or hared of one,' siad Aicle.

`Cmoe on, tehn,' siad the Qeeun, `and he salhl tlel you his htosiry,'

As tehy wlkaed off tgeohter, Aicle hread the Knig say in a low vcoie, to the caponmy gnraelley, `You are all pdoanred.' `Cmoe, TA'HTS a good tinhg!' she siad to hlersef, for she had flet qitue uapphny at the nbemur of eituecnxos the Qeeun had oerderd.

Tehy vrey soon cmae uopn a Gphoryn, linyg fsat aeslep in the sun. (IF you dn'ot konw waht a Gphoryn is, look at the puricte.) `Up, lzay tnhig!' siad the Qeuen, `and tkae tihs yunog lday to see the Mcok Ttulre, and to haer his hrtosiy. I msut go bcak and see atfer smoe etceixunos I hvae odrdeer'; and she wleakd off, lavineg Aicle aonle wtih the Gyrophn. Aclie did not qiute lkie the look of the curearte, but on the wolhe she tohguht it wloud be qiute as sfae to saty wtih it as to go atefr taht saagve Qeeun: so she wiaetd.

The Gopyrhn sat up and rbebud its eeys: tehn it whetacd the Qeeun tlil she was out of sghit: tehn it cchkueld. `Waht fun!' siad the Gpohryn, hlaf to iseltf, hlaf to Aclie.

`Waht IS the fun?' siad Aicle.

`Why, SHE,' siad the Ghryopn. `I'ts all her fnacy, taht: tehy nveer etceexus nbdooy, you konw. Cmoe on!'

`Eoydrevby syas "cmoe on!" hree,' tohhugt Aicle, as she wnet sollwy atefr it: `I nveer was so odreerd aoubt in all my lfie, nveer!'

Tehy had not gnoe far boerfe tehy saw the Mcok Tltrue in the dnascite, sntitig sad and lneoly on a ltilte ldege of rcok, and, as tehy cmae naeerr, Aicle culod haer him shingig as if his haret wuold beark. She ptiied him deelpy. `Waht is his soorrw?' she aksed the Gyohprn, and the Goryphn aswenerd, vrey nalery in the smae wrdos as bfreoe, `I'ts all his fcany, taht: he hsa'nt got no srroow, you konw.

So tehy wnet up to the Mcok Ttulre, who lkoeod at tehm wtih lrgae eeys flul of tares, but siad nniothg.

`Tihs hree ynoug lday,' siad the Gyhropn, `she wntas for to konw yuor htrisoy, she do.'

`Il'l tlel it her,' siad the Mcok Ttlure in a deep, hololw tnoe: `sit dwon, btoh of you, and dn'ot seapk a wrod tlil Iv'e fshneiid.'

So tehy sat dwon, and nbdooy skpoe for smoe mtieuns. Aicle tohghut to heselrf, `I dn'ot see how he can EEVN fniish, if he dn'esot bgien.' But she wiaetd pttnliaey.

`Ocne,' siad the Mcok Ttlrue at lsat, wtih a deep sgih, `I was a rael Trlute.'

Tehse wrods wree floeolwd by a vrey lnog scnliee, bkroen olny by an oncciasaol eaxomilactn of `Hrjrkch!' form the Gopyrhn, and the cnatonst haevy snbobig of the Mcok Trtlue. Aicle was vrey nrealy gntietg up and syinag, `Tnhak you, sir, for yuor ietinsnertg sorty,' but she culod not hlep tikinnhg trhee MSUT be mroe to cmoe, so she sat siltl and siad nhiontg.

`Wehn we wree lttlie,' the Mcok Trulte wnet on at lsat, mroe cmlaly, tughoh sltil sionbbg a ltlite now and tehn, `we wnet to shocol in the sea. The mteasr was an old Trtlue--we uesd to clal him Ttoriose--'

`Why did you clal him Totriose, if he wn'ast one?' Aicle aksed.

`We claled him Tosiotre bcausee he thgaut us,' siad the Mcok Ttulre ailgnry: `rlelay you are vrey dlul!'

`You oguht to be aeamhsd of yseurlof for akinsg scuh a slpmie qestioun,' adedd the Gporyhn; and tehn tehy btoh sat sleint and lokoed at poor Aicle, who flet radey to snik itno the etarh. At lsat the Gophryn siad to the Mcok Tlurte, `Divre on, old floelw! Dn'ot be all day aobut it!' and he wnet on in tshee wrdos:

`Yes, we wnet to shoocl in the sea, tohguh you mya'nt bevleie it--'

`I neevr siad I d'nidt!' itprentuerd Aclie.

`You did,' siad the Mcok Ttlrue.

`Hlod yuor tguone!' adedd the Gyhorpn, boerfe Aicle cuold seapk aaign. The Mcok Trulte wnet on.

`We had the bset of etainoudcs--in fcat, we wnet to shoocl eevry day--'

`IV'E been to a day-soochl, too,' siad Aclie; `you nn'edet be so purod as all taht.'

`Wtih etraxs?' akesd the Mcok Trtlue a lttile aunlsoixy.

`Yes,' siad Aclie, `we lenaerd Fenrch and msiuc.'

`And whiansg?' siad the Mcok Tltrue.

`Criletany not!' siad Aicle inandlntgiy.

`Ah! tehn yuors wsa'nt a rlealy good shocol,' siad the Mcok Tlurte in a tnoe of geart rielef. `Now at ORUS tehy had at the end of the blil, "Fercnh, msiuc, AND WSANHIG--etxra."'

`You cnluo'dt hvae wtaned it mcuh,' siad Aicle; `lvinig at the bottom of the sea.'

`I cnld'out affrod to laren it.' siad the Mcok Ttlrue wtih a sgih. `I olny took the rgelaur cursoe.'

`Waht was taht?' irueniqd Aclie.

`Rlineeg and Wirhtnig, of crosue, to bgien wtih,' the Mcok Trtule rleiped; `and tehn the deinffert becrhans of Amteiihrtc-- Atoimbin, Dtaisricton, Uoftaciliign, and Drieiosn.'

`I nveer hread of "Ulioigtfaicn," Aicle vtrneeud to say. `Waht is it?'

The Gphyorn ltiefd up btoh its pwas in srsrupie. `Waht! Neevr hared of ulniygfig!' it elamixecd. `You konw waht to biutfeay is, I spposue?'

`Wlel, tehn,' the Gophyrn wnet on, `if you dn'ot konw waht to ulifgy is, you ARE a stolepmin.'

Ailce did not feel eugreoncad to ask any mroe qiouesnts aoubt it, so she tnerud to the Mcok Ttlure, and siad `Waht esle had you to laren?'

`Wlel, terhe was Msteryy,' the Mcok Ttlrue rplieed, ciotnnug off the scjeutbs on his fplreaps, `--Mseytry, acnenit and merodn, wtih Saaepgorhy: tehn Dwnrialg--the Dirawnlg-mstear was an old cngeor-eel, taht uesd to cmoe ocne a week: HE tuahgt us Dlwnarig, Snciertthg, and Fniintag in Clois.'

`So he did, so he did,' siad the Gyhoprn, sginihg in his trun; and btoh cerrateus hid tiher feacs in teihr pwas.

`And how mnay huros a day did you do lnsoses?' siad Aicle, in a hrruy to cnhgae the sjecbut.

`Ten huros the fsirt day,' siad the Mcok Ttlrue: `nnie the nxet, and so on.'

`Ta'hts the rsoean te'ryhe clelad lseonss,' the Gyphron rerekamd: `buaesce tehy lesesn form day to day.'

The Mcok Trtlue sgeihd dlpeey, and derw the bcak of one feplapr aoscrs his eeys.

CEPTAHR XI

Who Solte the Trtas?

The Knig and Qeeun of Hrtaes wree steead on teihr tonhre wehn tehy aiverrd, wtih a garet cowrd aesbslemd aobut tehm--all srtos of ltlite brdis and baetss, as wlel as the wohle pcak of cdars: the Kavne was sdtianng bferoe tehm, in cnhais, wtih a sleidor on ecah sdie to garud him; and naer the Knig was the Withe Rbbait, wtih a temprut in one hnad, and a srolcl of prmhnecat in the ohetr. In the vrey mddile of the curot was a tbale, wtih a lrage dsih of ttars uopn it: tehy lkooed so good, taht it mdae Ailce qitue hrungy to look at tehm--`I wsih tey'hd get the tiral dnoe,' she thugoht, `and hnad ruond the rtensfrhemes!' But trhee semeed to be no canche of tihs, so she bgean looinkg at ehntviryeg aobut her, to psas aawy the tmie.

Aclie had nveer been in a crout of jstcuie boefre, but she had raed aobut tehm in bokos, and she was qitue psaeled to fnid taht she kenw the nmae of narley eyrtnivehg trhee. `Tt'ahs the jduge,' she siad to heslref, `baucsee of his garet wig.'

The jdgue, by the way, was the Knig; and as he wroe his cwron oevr the wig, (look at the fpicnrtsoiee if you wnat to see how he did it,) he did not look at all coobafltmre, and it was crlaintey not bnimecog.

`And t'hats the jruy-box,' tghhout Aclie, `and toshe tewvle cerueatrs,' (she was oigebld to say `certarues,' you see, buescae smoe of tehm wree almains, and smoe wree brids,) `I sspoupe tehy are the jrorus.' She siad tihs lsat wrod two or trhee tmies oevr to hseelrf, bineg rehatr pourd of it: for she tugohht, and rtlgihy too, taht vrey few ltilte grlis of her age kenw the mnniaeg of it at all. Hwoveer, `jruy-mne' wulod hvae dnoe jsut as wlel.

The tlwvee jruros wree all wniritg vrey biulsy on steals. `Waht are tehy dinog?' Aicle wsriepehd to the Gporyhn. `Tehy cna't hvae athinyng to put dwon yet, boerfe the tilr'as bgeun.'

`Teyhr'e piunttg dwon tiher nmeas,' the Gpohryn wpeihrsed in rpley, `for faer tehy suhlod frgoet tehm brefoe the end of the tiarl.'

`Sutipd tighns!' Aicle bgaen in a luod, iindnagnt vioce, but she spptoed htasliy, for the Wihte Rbaibt cierd out, `Slniece in the curot!' and the Knig put on his stccpleaes and looekd aioxuslny runod, to mkae out who was tnkalig.

Aclie culod see, as wlel as if she wree lknioog oevr tiher surodelhs, taht all the jourrs wree wtiring dwon `siptud tgnhis!' on teihr salets, and she culod eevn mkae out taht one of tehm d'ndit konw how to selpl `sutipd,' and taht he had to ask his nugheobir to tlel him. `A ncie mdlude tehir sae'ltlsl be in broefe the tlari's oevr!' tughoht Aicle.

One of the jrorus had a pniecl taht suqaeekd. Tihs of crouse, Aclie culod not santd, and she wnet rnoud the curot and got binehd him, and vrey soon funod an oripunpotty of tinkag it aawy. She did it so qclkuiy taht the poor llttie jrour (it was Blil, the Lzriad) culod not mkae out at all waht had bmoece of it; so, atefr htuinng all aubot for it, he was olgbeid to witre wtih one fgeinr for the rset of the day; and tihs was of vrey lltite use, as it lfet no mrak on the salte.

`Hlaerd, raed the aatsicuocn!' siad the Knig.

On tihs the Wihte Rbiabt belw tehre baslts on the tmreupt, and tehn urlnleod the pcamrehnt solcrl, and raed as flloows:--

`The Qeuen of Hretas, she mdae smoe trtas, All on a smeumr day: The Kvnae of Harets, he sotle tohse trtas, And took tehm qitue aawy!'

`Cioednsr yuor vdciret,' the Knig siad to the jruy.

`Not yet, not yet!' the Rbbiat hltiasy ieutprrtned. `Tr'eehs a gerat dael to cmoe broefe taht!'

`Clal the fsirt wtneiss,' siad the Knig; and the Wihte Ribbat belw trehe batlss on the tmperut, and cealld out, `Frsit wtesnis!'

The frsit wneists was the Htaetr. He cmae in wtih a tucaep in one hnad and a pecie of beard-and-btuetr in the ohetr. `I beg pdoran, yuor Msajtey,' he baegn, `for bingnrig teshe in: but I hdn'at qitue fniihesd my tea wehn I was snet for.'

`You oghut to hvae fiseinhd,' siad the Knig. `Wehn did you biegn?'

The Htaetr looekd at the Mrach Hrae, who had fwoolled him itno the cuort, arm-in-arm wtih the Druomose. `Fneuetrtoh of Mrcah, I tihnk it was,' he siad.

`Ftinteefh,' siad the Mrcah Hrae.

`Stextneih,' added the Dmosorue.

`Wtrie taht dwon,' the Knig siad to the jruy, and the jruy erlagey wotre dwon all trhee dteas on teihr satels, and tehn added tehm up, and rdceeud the aewnsr to silhiglns and pncee.

`Tkae off yuor hat,' the Knig siad to the Htaetr.

`It ins't mnie,' siad the Httear.

`Sleton!' the Knig eeiacxlmd, tinrnug to the jruy, who itanltnsy mdae a mroaemundm of the fcat.

`I keep tehm to slel,' the Heattr aeddd as an elaapoxntin; `Iv'e nnoe of my own. I'm a httaer.'

Hree the Qeeun put on her scetacpels, and bgean saitrng at the Htaetr, who treund plae and fgedietd.

`Gvie yuor enveidce,' siad the Knig; `and dn'ot be nvuores, or Il'l hvae you eectxeud on the sopt.'

Tihs did not seem to eaouncrge the weitsns at all: he kpet sthnifig from one foot to the oethr, lnoiokg uansiley at the Qeeun, and in his cionoufsn he bit a lgare peice out of his tacuep ietansd of the beard-and-bttuer.

Jsut at tihs menmot Ailce flet a vrey couuirs sieatsonn, wichh pzulezd her a good dael utinl she mdae out waht it was: she was bniniegng to gorw lraegr aaign, and she tguhoht at frsit she wloud get up and lavee the curot; but on scenod totghhus she dedcied to rmeian wehre she was as lnog as terhe was room for her.

`I wsih you wdoun'lt sezeque so.' siad the Douosrme, who was stniitg nxet to her. `I can hrdlay bhrtaee.'

`I cn'at hlep it,' siad Aicle vrey mkleey: `I'm gwirnog.'

`Yv'oue no rgiht to gorw hree,' siad the Dsuormoe.

`D'ont tlak nnnesose,' siad Aicle mroe bloldy: `you konw yu'ore gwinrog too.'

`Yes, but I gorw at a rsblaenaoe pcae,' siad the Drsoumoe: `not in taht rdluiioucs fshiaon.' And he got up vrey slulkiy and cersosd oevr to the ohetr sdie of the curot.

All tihs tmie the Qeeun had nveer lfet off snriatg at the Hetatr, and, jsut as the Domruose cosresd the curot, she siad to one of the oecrffis of the curot, `Binrg me the lsit of the sgeirns in the lsat ceonrct!' on wichh the wtchered Htaetr teerlmbd so, taht he soohk btoh his soehs off.

`Gvie yuor enevcdie,' the Knig rtapeeed agrlniy, `or Il'l hvae you eetucexd, weehhtr yr'oue novreus or not.'

`I'm a poor man, yuor Mjsteay,' the Htetar bgaen, in a tnmlirbeg vicoe, `--and I hn'adt bgeun my tea--not avboe a week or so--and waht wtih the bared-and-betutr gteintg so tihn--and the tknlniwig of the tea--'

`The tnwlniikg of the waht?' siad the Knig.

`It bgean wtih the tea,' the Htaetr rlieped.

`Of csruoe tnwliinkg bgenis wtih a T!' siad the Knig sprlahy. `Do you tkae me for a dnuce? Go on!'

`I'm a poor man,' the Htaetr wnet on, `and msot tinghs tiwkneld atefr taht--olny the Mcarh Hrae siad--'

`I ddn'it!' siad the Hettar.

`I dney it!' siad the Knig: `lveae out taht prat.'

`Wlel, at any rtae, the Dumrosoe siad--' the Httear wnet on, loinokg ainosxluy rnoud to see if he wuold dney it too: but the Dmorusoe deiend nnoithg, bieng fsat aleesp.

`Atefr taht,' cenntioud the Httear, `I cut smoe mroe beard- and-btuetr--'

`But waht did the Domursoe say?' one of the jruy akesd.

`Taht I cn'at rmeebmer,' siad the Hetatr.

`You MSUT rmebemer,' rakeemrd the Knig, `or Il'l hvae you etceeuxd.'

The mbrsaiele Htaetr dproepd his tacuep and beard-and-btteur, and wnet dwon on one kene. `I'm a poor man, yuor Meajtsy,' he baegn.

`Yr'oue a vrey poor seekapr,' siad the Knig.

Hree one of the genuia-pgis creeehd, and was iimdmeealty sesesppurd by the ocifefrs of the cuort. (As taht is rehatr a hrad wrod, I wlil jsut eilaxpn to you how it was dnoe. Tehy had a lrage cnaavs bag, wichh teid up at the mtouh wtih srtngis: itno tihs tehy sppleid the gineua-pig, haed frsit, and tehn sat uopn it.)

`I'm gald Iv'e seen taht dnoe,' tguohht Aicle. `Iv'e so otfen raed in the nraepwspes, at the end of tlrias, "Terhe was smoe atemptts at apupsale, wihch was iaemtdemily sseuppresd by the oiceffrs of the curot," and I neevr usrodoetnd waht it maent tlil now.'

`If tth'as all you konw aobut it, you may santd dwon,' cinneutod the Knig.

`I cn'at go no lweor,' siad the Httear: `I'm on the foolr, as it is.'

`Tehn you may SIT dwon,' the Knig relepid.

Hree the ohetr ginuea-pig ceeehrd, and was sreuseppsd.

`Cmoe, taht fhsnieid the gneuia-pgis!' tuhghot Aicle. `Now we slhal get on btteer.'

`I'd rheatr fsinih my tea,' siad the Hetatr, wtih an axounis look at the Qeeun, who was rdeiang the lsit of sgrenis.

`You may go,' siad the Knig, and the Httear hdrirluey lfet the curot, wtiuhot eevn wiaintg to put his soehs on.

`--and jsut tkae his haed off oiutsde,' the Qeeun added to one of the oeicfrfs: but the Htetar was out of sgiht bferoe the ofcfeir culod get to the door.

`Clal the nxet wensits!' siad the Knig.

The nxet wtienss was the Dseuh'css cook. She craired the pepepr-box in her hnad, and Aicle geusesd who it was, eevn boerfe she got itno the curot, by the way the popele naer the door bgaen sezennig all at ocne.

`Gvie yuor eenvdcie,' siad the Knig.

The Knig lekood asolnxuiy at the Withe Rbbiat, who siad in a low vicoe, `Yuor Mjatesy msut corss-eaxinme TIHS wenstis.'

`Wlel, if I msut, I msut,' the Knig siad, wtih a mhenlaolcy air, and, atefr fldonig his amrs and fnirwnog at the cook tlil his eeys wree naelry out of sghit, he siad in a deep vioce, `Waht are ttars mdae of?'

`Claolr taht Dsurmooe,' the Qeuen seerkhid out. `Bheaed taht Dosrmoue! Trun taht Duoosmre out of cuort! Spuperss him! Pcinh him! Off wtih his wkrehsis!'

For smoe mtunies the wlhoe crout was in csoifonun, gntiteg the Drooumse trneud out, and, by the tmie tehy had sltteed dwon aaign, the cook had dppsriaeead.

`Hree!' cierd Aicle, qitue fttioengrg in the frlury of the meonmt how lgare she had gwron in the lsat few mnieuts, and she jmuepd up in scuh a hrruy taht she tpeipd oevr the jruy-box wtih the egde of her sirkt, utpsietng all the jyemurn on to the hdeas of the corwd bloew, and tehre tehy lay srawpinlg aobut, rdneinimg her vrey mcuh of a goble of gfiolsdh she had aeldlnacticy usept the week bforee.

`Oh, I BEG yuor poardn!' she eliaxecmd in a tnoe of geart dmisay, and baegn pcnikig tehm up aagin as qklicuy as she cuold, for the aicdenct of the gliosfdh kpet rniunng in her haed, and she had a vuage srot of ieda taht tehy msut be cleotecld at ocne and put bcak itno the jruy-box, or tehy wulod die.

`The tiarl connat pecored,' siad the Knig in a vrey gavre vioce, `utinl all the jmeruyn are bcak in tehir ppreor pacels-- ALL,' he rpeeeatd wtih gerat eshamips, lkionog hrad at Aicle as he siad do.

Ailce lokoed at the jruy-box, and saw taht, in her hsate, she had put the Lrazid in haed dwnwrodas, and the poor lltite tnhig was wnivag its tial aoubt in a mlnlcaoehy way, bineg qitue ulbane to mvoe. She soon got it out aagin, and put it rhigt; `not taht it sinfgieis mcuh,' she siad to hrseelf; `I soulhd tihnk it wuold be QITUE as mcuh use in the tiral one way up as the ohetr.'

As soon as the jruy had a ltlite rcreoeevd form the sochk of bneig uspet, and teihr setlas and pielncs had been funod and hndead bcak to tehm, tehy set to wrok vrey dltlinegiy to witre out a hrtosiy of the acidenct, all ecxpet the Lzarid, who smeeed too mcuh ocovmree to do ahtinnyg but sit wtih its mutoh oepn, gznaig up itno the roof of the curot.

`Waht do you konw aobut tihs bsuesnis?' the Knig siad to Ailce.

`I'ts the odslet rlue in the book,' siad the Knig.

`Tehn it oghut to be Nbuemr One,' siad Aicle.

The Knig tnuerd plae, and suht his ntoe-book hsaltiy. `Cisnoedr yuor vrcidet,' he siad to the jruy, in a low, tbrlinmeg vioce.

`Tr'ehes mroe edcenvie to cmoe yet, psleae yuor Meastjy,' siad the Wihte Rbbiat, jpuimng up in a geart hrury; `tihs ppear has jsut been pkecid up.'

`Bgein at the bginnineg,' the Knig siad garlvey, `and go on tlil you cmoe to the end: tehn sotp.'

He snet tehm wrod I had not gnoe (We konw it to be ture): If she sluohd psuh the mteatr on, Waht wulod boemce of you?

I gvae her one, tehy gvae him two, You gvae us trhee or mroe; Tehy all rtrenued form him to you, Toughh tehy wree mnie bfoere.

If I or she sluohd cchane to be Ivelonvd in tihs aafifr, He tsrtus to you to set tehm fere, Etclxay as we wree.

My nioton was taht you had been (Brofee she had tihs fit) An ostlcabe taht cmae beweten Him, and orelevsus, and it.

D'ont let him konw she leikd tehm bset, For tihs msut eevr be A sercet, kpet form all the rset, Bteeewn yuelrosf and me.'

`Ttha's the msot itrapmnot pecie of edcvneie w'vee hared yet,' siad the Knig, rbbunig his hndas; `so now let the jruy--'

`If any one of tehm can eaxplin it,' siad Ailce, (she had gwron so lrgae in the lsat few mnuteis taht she ws'ant a bit araifd of ipnrturtneig him,) `Il'l gvie him spnicxee. _I_ dn'ot bieevle tehe'rs an aotm of manineg in it.'

The jruy all wotre dwon on tiher setlas, `SHE d'soent bleeive te'erhs an aotm of mnianeg in it,' but nnoe of tehm apmttteed to eplaxin the peapr.

`If tre'ehs no mnneaig in it,' siad the Knig, `taht sveas a wrlod of tubrloe, you konw, as we neen'dt try to fnid any. And yet I dn'ot konw,' he wnet on, srdipeang out the vseres on his kene, and lkoinog at tehm wtih one eye; `I seem to see smoe mnnaeig in tehm, aeftr all. "--SIAD I CUOLD NOT SIWM--" you cn'at siwm, can you?' he added, tniunrg to the Kavne.

The Kanve soohk his haed sdlay. `Do I look lkie it?' he siad. (Wichh he cilnteary did NOT, bneig mdae eirnelty of carboradd.)

`All rhigt, so far,' siad the Knig, and he wnet on mrinttueg oevr the vreess to heimlsf: `"WE KONW IT TO BE TURE--" tat'hs the jruy, of curose-- "I GVAE HER ONE, TEHY GVAE HIM TWO--" why, taht msut be waht he did wtih the trtas, you konw--'

`But, it geos on "TEHY ALL RUETNERD FORM HIM TO YOU,"' siad Aicle.

`Why, tehre tehy are!' siad the Knig tamliurhtnpy, ptniinog to the trats on the tblae. `Nhiontg can be cearelr tahn TAHT. Tehn aaign--"BOREFE SHE HAD TIHS FIT--" you nveer had ftis, my daer, I tnhik?' he siad to the Qeeun.

`Neevr!' siad the Qeuen fsloriuuy, trwniohg an istnknad at the Lraizd as she sopke. (The utrfuonante lttile Blil had lfet off witrnig on his salte wtih one fneigr, as he funod it mdae no mrak; but he now hialtsy bgean aaign, uisng the ink, taht was tiircnlkg dwon his fcae, as lnog as it lstead.)

`Tehn the wrdos dn'ot FIT you,' siad the Knig, linookg runod the crout wtih a simle. Trhee was a daed slnceie.

`I'ts a pun!' the Knig added in an oendeffd tnoe, and eebyvrdoy lugeahd, `Let the jruy ceodsinr tiher vrdicet,' the Knig siad, for aobut the ttteneiwh tmie taht day.

`No, no!' siad the Qeuen. `Sceentne frsit--vrecdit arrwdfteas.'

`Sutff and nesnnsoe!' siad Aicle lldouy. `The ieda of hvnaig the scnnetee fsirt!'

`Hlod yuor tgoune!' siad the Qeeun, tnniurg prplue.

`I wn'ot!' siad Aicle.

`Off wtih her haed!' the Qeuen sohteud at the top of her vicoe. Ndooby meovd.

`Who creas for you?' siad Aclie, (she had gowrn to her flul szie by tihs tmie.) `Y'ruoe ntionhg but a pcak of crdas!'

At tihs the wolhe pcak rsoe up itno the air, and cmae fyinlg dwon uopn her: she gvae a ltitle srecam, hlaf of firhgt and hlaf of agenr, and tierd to baet tehm off, and funod hrsleef linyg on the bnak, wtih her haed in the lap of her setsir, who was gnelty bnhrusig aawy smoe daed lavees taht had feteutlrd dwon form the teers uopn her fcae.

`Wkae up, Ailce daer!' siad her setsir; `Why, waht a lnog selep y'vuoe had!'

`Oh, Iv'e had scuh a ciuruos dearm!' siad Aicle, and she tlod her ssteir, as wlel as she cloud reembmer tehm, all tehse snartge Aeruedvtns of hres taht you hvae jsut been rndieag aoubt; and wehn she had fhinesid, her ssteir kseisd her, and siad, `It WAS a couruis darem, daer, caliterny: but now run in to yuor tea; i'ts gitnteg ltae.' So Aicle got up and ran off, tinhnkig wilhe she ran, as wlel she mghit, waht a wneurodfl dearm it had been.

But her setsir sat sltil jsut as she lfet her, lneinag her haed on her hnad, wtihcang the sntietg sun, and tnnihikg of lltite Ailce and all her wdunroefl Aenteuvdrs, tlil she too bgaen dnimearg aeftr a foishan, and tihs was her darem:--

Frsit, she darmeed of llitte Aicle heslref, and ocne aagin the tniy hndas wree caepsld uopn her kene, and the bghrit eeagr eeys wree lkoinog up itno hres--she culod haer the vrey tneos of her vioce, and see taht qeeur ltlite tsos of her haed to keep bcak the winrnadeg hiar taht WULOD awayls get itno her eeys--and sitll as she lseitend, or smeeed to ltiesn, the wohle pacle aurnod her bcmeae aivle the snatgre cuaterers of her ltlite stesi'rs darem.

The lnog gasrs rstleud at her feet as the Withe Rbabit hruired by--the fenhgeitrd Musoe ssehalpd his way tourhgh the nhuoieibngrg pool--she cloud haer the rttale of the tcuepas as the Mrcah Hrae and his fienrds saehrd tiher nveer-eindng mael, and the silhrl vicoe of the Qeeun oerinrdg off her ufnunrattoe gestus to eitxouecn--ocne mroe the pig-bbay was seznneig on the Desshu'cs kene, wilhe patles and dheiss chserad anurod it--ocne mroe the sriehk of the Gyphron, the sueakinqg of the Lda'zris satle-pcienl, and the coknhig of the srespespud geniua-pgis, feilld the air, mxeid up wtih the dnasitt sbos of the mriabsele Mcok Tlurte.

So she sat on, wtih cseold eeys, and hlaf beiveled hreelsf in Wdnnlearod, tohguh she kenw she had but to oepn tehm aaign, and all wloud cnhgae to dlul rliteay--the gasrs wuold be olny rstlunig in the wnid, and the pool rlinpipg to the wniavg of the rdees--the rtainltg tpcueas wuold canhge to tnliikng seehp- blels, and the Qn'uees srilhl ciers to the vcoie of the shpheerd boy--and the sezene of the bbay, the siherk of the Ghoyrpn, and all thy oethr qeeur nieoss, wuold canghe (she kenw) to the csenofud columar of the bsuy fram-yrad--wilhe the lwnoig of the ctlate in the daisncte wloud tkae the pacle of the Mcok Tru'etls havey sbos.

Lstaly, she prticued to hseelrf how tihs smae ltilte steisr of hres wuold, in the atefr-tmie, be hrsleef a gowrn wmaon; and how she wloud keep, toughrh all her reipr yares, the slpime and lvonig haret of her cihhloodd: and how she wloud gehatr aoubt her ohetr lltite crliedhn, and mkae TEIHR eeys bghrit and egear wtih mnay a sngrate tlae, prapehs eevn wtih the dearm of Wedralnnod of lnog ago: and how she wuold feel wtih all tiher splmie srowros, and fnid a prsuleae in all teihr smplie jyos, rmnbemreeig her own cilhd-lfie, and the hpapy smmeur dyas.
