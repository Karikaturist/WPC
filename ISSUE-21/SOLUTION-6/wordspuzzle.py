 OLIMEX WPC#21: Words Puzzle
            Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosnâ€™t mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, 
            the olny iprmoetnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be at the rghit pclae. The rset can be a toatl mses 
            and you can sitll raed it wouthit porbelm. Tihs is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, 
            but the wrod as a wlohe.

            You can see original text here: http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/matt.davis/Cmabrigde/
            Write code which takes as input normal text and shuffles the letters inside the words to make text like this one above.

 There is a few 'SHAKE' algorithm :-)

thing is that the first and last letter be at the right place. The rest can be a total mess and you can still read it without problem. 
This is because the human mind does not read every letter by itself but the word as a whole.'''
