According to a researcher (sic) at Cambridge University, it doesn't matter in what order the letters in a word
are, the only important thing is that the first and last letter be at the right place.
The rest can be a total mess and you can still read it without problem. This is
because the human mind does not read every letter by itself but the word as a whole.

This text circulated on the internet in September 2003. I first became aware of it when a journalist contacted
a my colleague Sian Miller on 16th September, trying to track down the original
source. It's been passed on many times, and in the way of most internet memes
has mutated along the way. It struck me as interesting - especially when I
received a version that mentioned Cambridge University! I work at Cognition and
Brain Sciences Unit, in Cambridge, UK, a Medical Research Council unit that
includes a large group investigating how the brain processes language. If there's
a new piece of research on reading that's been conducted in Cambridge, I
thought I should have heard of it before...

I've written this page, to try to explain the science behind this meme. There are elements of truth in this, but
also some things which scientists studying the psychology of language
(psycholinguists) know to be incorrect. I'm going to break down the meme, one
line at a time to illustrate these points, pointing out what I think is the relevant
research on the role of letter order on reading. Again, this is only my view of the
current state of reading research, as it relates to this meme. If you think I've
missed something important, let me know.
