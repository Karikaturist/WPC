##WPC - OLIMEX's WEEKEND PROGRAMMING CHALLENGE

###ISSUES 51-100



#####issue51: Container load
Freight company have N parcels with different dimensions to fit in 20 feet containers. Make code which optimally fill containers inside volume. Assume that there is no limitations to stack the parcels.


#####issue52: H-bot
H-bot is simple way to control X-Y CNC table with just two stepper motors and string. More on the subject you can find 
on the net. Make code which moves the CNC table at position X,Y by rotating the two stepper motors. You know the string 
length, motor shaft diameter, etc parameters. Starting from center 0,0 you calculate the rotation angle of both motors 
when new X,Y coordinate is entered. 0,0 is in the center so XY can be positive and negative.
 		 

#####issue53: Random Number Generator
Make your own Random Number Generator.
       
       
#####issue54: FFT
Fourier Transform is basic instrument for spectrum analyze of signals. 
Make Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) implementation in your favourite language, try to compute the spectrum  on sample sound file and to visualize it.


#####issue55: Draw Bot
Today’s challenge was inspired by this article: http://makezine.com/projects/trs-drawbot/ .
Simple draw bot draws continual line without lifting the pen up. From what I see the lines do not cross.


#####issue56: Perfect Numbers
Perfect Number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.
This weekend try to calculate the largest Perfect Number you can and let us know what result did you got.


#####issue57: Text to HTML ratio calculator
Some people think text to HTML tags ratio on web page is important parameter for Google indexing 
and good sites should have about 20-30% ratio of pure text vs HTML tags.
Make code which calculates Text/HTML ratio on given html page.


#####issue58: Date to Seconds converter
Make code which enters Gregorian calendar date in format: Day/Month/Year and calculates how many seconds passed since the beginning.


#####issue59: Big – Little Endians
Make code which detects on what machine is ran – with Big or Little Endian. Can you do it in other language than C?


#####issue60: PTC linearization
KTY81/110 is non linear resistor which increases it’s value with temperature. 
You can read the datasheet here: http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/KTY81_SER.pdf
Make code which input KTY81/110 real number of resistance in ohms and output the temperature of the sensor.
