ISSUE #25 - Equal Paths
===
Problem:
If we have matrix with size M x N and two points A(xa,ya) and B(xb,yb), C obstracles which are entered with their coordinates and and length of path L
Make code which:

 inputs the matrix size M and N
 inputs the point A(x,y) coordinates
 inputs the point B(x,y) coordinates
 inputs the number of Obstracles C
 inputs the obstracles C(x,y) coordinates
 inputs the path length
Then displays all variants (if any) one can move from point A to point B by traveling via L cells. You can step on one cell just once and only if the cell have no obstracle.

The valid moves are only up-down-left-right.
