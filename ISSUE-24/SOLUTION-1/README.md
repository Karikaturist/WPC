OLIMEX Weekend solution
-----------------------

Solution for the weekend challenge #24.

The problem is called Partitioning problem, and I present a recursive method. It is not efficient, but reduces code length since it is recursive in nature.

USAGE
-----

	python partition.py 5

The output will be:
	set([(1, 1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 2, 2), (5,), (2, 3), (1, 1, 1, 2), (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)])
