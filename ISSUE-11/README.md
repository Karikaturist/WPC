===

Problem:

Let’s have maze with size X x Y where X and Y are integer (3..100) .
The maze is defined with strings, where in the string ‘W’ is wall, ‘@’ is obstracle and ‘ ‘ is air.
Make code which finds the larges by area connected obstracles in the maze.

For instance:

Input:

WWWWWWWWWW
W  WW    W
W       WW
W  @@    W
W @@     W
W      @ W
W@    @@ W
WWWWWWWWWW
should output: 4 as the largest area obstracles is composed by 4 @ connected together.
