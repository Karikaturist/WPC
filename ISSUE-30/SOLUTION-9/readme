Hello,

I had a go at this week's programming challenge in Ada. Attached is the
result.

I would like to raise the awareness that AdaCore is still figuring out
whether they will release their Ada compiler for ARM under GPL license (the
non-free is existing already). If we get enough buy-in from the community
it would surely help this brilliant language forward...
Maybe a good topic for your blog?

Cheers,
MAZA
