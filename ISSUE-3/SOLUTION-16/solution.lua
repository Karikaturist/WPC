The problem
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Letâ€™s have N different strings/words for each word print the minimum part of it which makes it unique toward others, for example:

input:
A13-OLinuXino
iMX233-OLinuXino
MOD-PULSE
MOD-IO
<end>

result:
A13-OLinuXino -> a
iMX233-OLinuXino -> 2
MOD-PULSE -> p
MOD-IO -> -i

The solution
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We look for all possible substrings, but we do it smartly. Instead of comparing
strings all the time, we compare numbers and we resort to comparing strings only
when the numbers match. In other words, for each string, we keep an array called
"sum". The function that looks for the smallest unique substring starts with
strings of size 1. At this point, "sum" simply contains the ASCII values of each
char in the string. For example, if the string was "0123", "sum" will contain this:

{48, 49, 50, 51}

(side note: I really hope you're not doing UNICODE. But that's OK, since standard
Lua can't handle UNICODE anyway :) ).

Each string given as input has such a "sum" array. The algorithm will search for each
element in "sum" of the target string in all the "sum" arrays of the other strings, 
stopping as soon as it finds an unique sum. If this doesn't work for single chars,
the algorithm will start looking for solutions of size 2 and this is where things get
interesting. The "sum" array will be updated to contain the sums of two consecutive
elemnts of the string, in other words:

{ 48 + 49, 49 + 50, 50 + 51 }

If 2 chars don't work either, we get to 3 chars:

{ 48 + 49 + 50, 49 + 50 + 51 }

And finally 4 chars:

{ 48 + 49 + 50 + 51 }

In order words, the element sum[ i ] for a solution of size "s" contains the sum
of the ASCII chars of the first "s" chars in the string, starting from position "i".
It's immediately obvious that sum[ i ] for solution size "s" can be computed from the
value of sum[ i ] for solution size "s-1" by simply adding another ASCII value. The
nice part about this is that we are searching for these sums instead of comparing 
strings; only when two sums match we actually compare the strings (since having two
equal sums doesn't guarantee that the strings are indeed equal (take for example
"04" and "12")).

As another optimization, we compute the "sum" array only on demand and we cache
all the already computed sums in "all_sums" (both of these are handled by the 
"get_sums" function below). Caching is important, since succesive calls of 
"solve" will definitely try to use the same sums we computed before while searching
for unique strings.

NOTE: the program is optimized for speed, not space. With all the memoization of the
"sums" array, it can probably take quite a bit of memory.
