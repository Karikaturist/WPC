Simple PHP coding to solve your problem:

1) ./skytale-enc.php diameter cleartext
will encode the "cleartext" using skytale. the solution is simple and based
on str_split. it also pads the last block so it can be decrypted nicely.
2) ./skytale-dec.php diameter encryptedtext
will decode the "encryptedtext" using skytale. the same as above (the
scripts are mirrored images).
