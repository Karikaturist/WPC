WPC#50: Circle Find
    In window with size 100 x 100 pixels is drawn solid filled circle with 50 pixels diameter at random coordinates X,Y 
    but the circle is completely inside the window. Make code which finds the circle XY coordinates.
    
   
    XBM image format is used as input.
    1) To create test image, use ImageMagick command line utilities:
    
        e.g.:   $ convert -size 100x100 xc:white -fill black -draw "circle 49,49,74,49" c1.xbm
          or:   $ convert -size 100x100 xc:white -fill black -draw "circle 40,30,65,30" c2.xbm
        
       See what you created:   $ display c1.xbm         
        
        
    2) cmass.py:    my solution for WPC#38, which is applicable here, too. You can use my 'gmass.py' from WPC#38, too.
    
        $ ./cmass.py c1.xbm
        
    
    3) fcircle.py: 
        Algorithm:  The center must be in the rectangle which has (x,y) corner coordinates:
                     (R,R), (width-R-1,R), (R,height-R-1), (width-R-1,height-R-1). 
                    A (cx,cy) point of the rectangle treated as center point 
                    if (cx,cy), (cx-R,y),(cx+R,y) are black (i.e.: belongs to the circle).
                    
        $ ./fcircle.py c1.xbm            

    
    Note: A perfect circle can not be drawn, the circles have some granularity on the edges.
          'fcircle.py' doesn't average this granularity, but the 'cmass.py' does it.
