WPC - OLIMEX's WEEKEND PROGRAMMING CHALLENGE
===


The idea for this Weekend Programming Challenge came as follow up of our Friday Free Board Quiz: http://olimex.wordpress.com/2013/03/22/weekend-programming-challenge/
It's over the weekend competition, where every Friday we post problem on our blog and you have one weekend time to think and come with the best solution.
In Monday we will upload the solutions here and by the end of the day we will analyze and rise winner.

After we post the solutions everyone is welcome to e-mail us at support [at] olimex [dot] com their favourite solution with arguments why they think this solution is best.
This way we will be sure that more eyes will look at the codes and we may not miss something :)
