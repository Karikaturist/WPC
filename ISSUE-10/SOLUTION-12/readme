And again a Java solution from me :) It using a greedy algorithm (I
found out after writing it that its basically the Fibonacci algorithm).
Unfortunately for some pathological inputs using integer (or long)
arithmetic mens it won't terminate properly (due to number overflows).
But I will leave it as it is, for now...

Code goes into a de/hendriklipka/contest/olimex/contest10 directory to
be compiled. It takes the two numbers as command line arguments.
