Hi there.  Attached is my try at a Sudoku solver.  It takes an ASCII
file as an input with '.' for the blank cell and optional comment
lines.  It outputs the first found solution and gives a basic
benchmark of the number of updates tried per second.

The source is at:
 https://juju.net.nz/src/hacks.git/tree/sudoku

including some test boards.

Some basic benchmarks:

Feroceon 88FR131 / 2.0 GHz ARMv5 / GCC 4.6.3: 16.0 M/s
i.MX6 Quad / 1.0 GHz Cortex-A9 / GCC 4.7.3: 14.4 M/s
Core 2 P8600 / 2.4 GHz Core 2 / GCC 4.7.3: 54.2 M/s

It'd be pretty easy to make this multi-threaded - find the first cell
and spawn a thread to check each solution from there down.
