WPC - issue 4

Python code to find the longest isogram in the input text.

Code is quite simple, it isolates unique strings in the input text, then
sort them, in the way that longer strings are processed first.

The first found isogram is printed, as it is the longest one. 

I assume that words consists of letters (a-z, and A-Z).
Code reads input from stdin and output result to stdout.
