WPC - issue 4

x86 assembler code to find the longest isogram in the input text.

The solution require x86 compatible machine, Linux, nasm, and make to compile.
It uses sys_read to read the input text from stdin.

Code is quite fast and has low memory footprint.

It reads at most 8192 bytes from STDIN, than splits words from imput text and
checks if the given word is isogram. 

Assembly code is faster about 4 times than my Python code for large data
sets. And about 10 times for small data sets (like the Alice in Wonderland).

Please execute "make" compile the source.
It tries to detect arch type (32bit, or AMD64).

I assume that words consists of letters (a-z, and A-Z).  
Code reads input from stdin and output result to stdout.
