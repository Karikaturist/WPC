Here's my solution to this week's challenge. Some remarks:

* Since English is not my mother language, I actually checked (just in
case) this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_numerals and this
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_differences#Numbers

Either way, what was written on the blog
> three thousands five hundreds and twenty five plus one hundred and
thirty three is equal to
is incorrect, it should be "hundred".

* Doesn't matter if the American or British english is used, "and" and
"-" are just removed, as well as "is equal to".

* It also supports stuff like "fifteen hundred".

* Regarding the / opperation, I don't really know if I was supposed to
use the exact division or assume the result would be a natural number. I
assumed the latter.

* I assumed all numbers where non-negative integers, that is, "minus one
plus minus two is equal to" is not a valid input.

I'm pretty sure some stuff can be done in a more elegant way, but oh
well, programming is not my field.

Sergio.
