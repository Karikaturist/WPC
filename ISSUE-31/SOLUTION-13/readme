Hello,

Attached are my solutions to WPC #31.

One version is written in Haskell and the other one in C.
Both versions are functionally identical (I have used them to test each 
other).
The C version is faster than the Haskell one, but perhaps less easier 
to read.

Both programs implement run-length encoding and decoding of a file in 
one of two ways:
- by writing n b where n is the repeat count and b the byte to be 
repeated
- by writing b if byte b is not repeated or b b n if byte b is repeated 
n times
The second version is obviously better to compress fairly random data.

Best regards,

Marc
