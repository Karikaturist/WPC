ISSUE#8 - Hangman
===

Problem:

Make unbeatable Hangman game.

Everybody knows Hangman game http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game) and it’s very easy to implement one even with ASCII art on the computer text terminal console, so we will not focus on fancy graphics in this challenge.

To generate the guess word you can use some free English word list, for instance from here: http://dreamsteep.com/projects/the-english-open-word-list.html which contains about 128,000 words.

The challenge this weekend is to make the computer unbeatable. How?
Each time the player guess letter, if this letter is in your word you have to scan the dictionary for similar word (if possible and do not break the game rules) which have no such letter and replace it, so player is always wrong  .
