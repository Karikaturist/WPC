ISSUE #44 - ECG heartbeat detector
===
We all have seen how ECG looks stylized, in real life there is usually lot of noise add to this signal.
For today’s Challenge I asked one of our employee – Penko to connect himself to EEG-SMT and to stay calm so his ECG signal is captured on file. This file is already upload to GitHub and you can use as input data.
Make code which detect the heart rate using this raw signal info.
Description of the data packages is also upload on Github.
