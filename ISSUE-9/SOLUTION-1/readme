Hello Olimex team,

attached you find my solution. Its in Java, and needs to go in a folder
"de/hendriklipka/contest/olimex/contest09". It expects a filename on
the command lines. The file needs to have the number of points as its
first line, and the all other points in "x,y" format on each line.

The algorithm is pretty simple - the program first reads the first 3
points, and calculates a circle from their coordinates (can be only
one, if there is no circle we can abort here). After that, it checks
for each remaining point whether it is on the circle or not.

Since calculation even with double precision are not entirely accurate,
the comparision for the last step involves a EPSILON value - when the
point in question is closer than this value to the circle, it is
considered to be on it.
