===

Problem:

Input string which is mathematical statement written in normal Infix Notation and convert it to Postfix Notation.

Infix notation is the normal way we write mathematical statements like:

(10 + 20) / (30 - 40)
Postfix notation (also known as Reverse Polish notation) is where every operator follows all of its operands and is parenthesis-free, the above statement written in Postfix notation is:

10 20 + 30 40 - /
