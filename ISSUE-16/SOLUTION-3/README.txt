Hello, guys!
This is my solution. It is written in C++. I have used Edsger Dijkstra's algorithm. 
It is called Shunting-yard algorithm.
Here is more information about it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm
If someone have idea how to write it better and cleaner or  just want to talk about programming 
with me I will be glad to hear his advice.
