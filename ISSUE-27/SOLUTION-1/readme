Hello,

Attached is my entry for the #27 weekend programming challenge.

The program was written in Free Pascal and uses OpenGL to render the 
calculated flight path (with and without air resistance). A short video 
illustrates the output of the program.

Parameters used by the program are:
     Mass of the object in kg
     Initial force in N
     Time interval in seconds during which initial force was applied
     Elevation of starting position in m
     Launch angle in rad
     Gravitational acceleration in m/s^2
     Frontal surface area of object in m^2
     Drag coefficient of the object (dimensionless constant)
     Air density in kg/m^3

Kind regards,

Marc
