In .Net, this problem is extremely trivial using functions built into the .Net framework; just one line of code.  This is hardly taxing so I wrote some code myself to calculate the seconds since the start of the Gregorian calendar on 15th October 1582 and ran input dates against both calculations to check whether my algorithm works.  The proof is in the screenshot image.  I'm sure it could be optimized but it seems to work anyway.  Enjoy.
