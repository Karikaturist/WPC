Hello,

I attach my solution written in Python. I hope the description written in
the comments is clear enough, it would be much clearer with an image :)

I didn't put much attention to verification of the correctnes of the input
data because it's not the point of the challange. The program accepts six
integer/floating point numbers separated with whatever characters. The
problem which can be noticed is the precision of calculations, so in case
of real distance equal to 0 you can see some really small number.

Best regards!
Mati
