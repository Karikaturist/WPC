Hey,
I implemented the algorithm to calculate the distance in java and uploaded it to github.
It can be looked up with this link:  https://gist.github.com/Dreistein/5223381
For explanation: The source-code is fully documented. The method LineDistance.getDistance takes three Point objects (which is a helper class  i made; can also be found in the gist) and calculates the distance with
Heron's Formula ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_(triangle)#Altitude_in_terms_of_the_sides )

I also uploaded a simple test-class to show the usage of the method and the classes.

Hope you like it :)
