 Hi, this is one way to solve the challenge by using very simple mathematical theory.
I used sagemath to simplify the norm() and cross_product functions.
They are easy to write, but they are already included in the library.
 
 the line is defined by AB. The point is C.
To run the program just import it in sagemath for python (online or local) and call:

resolve_challenge(a_x,a_y,b_x,b_y,c_x,c_y)
